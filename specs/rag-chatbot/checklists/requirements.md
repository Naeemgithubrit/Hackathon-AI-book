# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Chatbot for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Detailed Analysis

**Content Quality**: The spec maintains business focus throughout. All requirements describe WHAT users need and WHY, without specifying HOW to implement. Technical stack mentions are limited to constraints section only.

**Requirement Completeness**:
- 18 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) are all testable and unambiguous
- 9 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-009) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 3 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- 8 edge cases identified
- Scope clearly bounded in "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: All three user stories can be independently developed, tested, and deployed. Each has clear acceptance scenarios that can be verified without knowing implementation details.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` (if needed) or `/sp.plan`
- No blocking issues identified
- All mandatory sections are complete and high-quality
