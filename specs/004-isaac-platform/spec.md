## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Launch Isaac Sim with Humanoid (Priority: P1)

Student wants to quickly launch Isaac Sim 2025 with a humanoid robot model connected to ROS 2, achieving at least 60 FPS performance within 10 minutes of starting the tutorial.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that all other learning activities depend on. Without a working simulation environment, students cannot progress to perception, navigation, or synthetic data generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching Isaac Sim with a humanoid model and measuring FPS performance and startup time. Delivers immediate value by allowing students to visualize and interact with the robot in simulation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has installed Isaac Sim 2025 and ROS 2, **When** student follows tutorial steps to launch simulation with humanoid model, **Then** simulation runs at ≥60 FPS within 10 minutes of starting
2. **Given** student has Ubuntu 22.04 with RTX 4070 Ti, **When** student launches Isaac Sim + ROS 2 bridge, **Then** humanoid robot is controllable through ROS 2 interface

### User Story 2 - Deploy VSLAM and Navigation on Jetson (Priority: P2)

Student wants to deploy Isaac ROS VSLAM and Nav2 on Jetson Orin Nano with a live RealSense D435i camera, building a map in under 30 seconds.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the core perception and navigation capabilities that are essential for autonomous robotics, bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting RealSense D435i to Jetson Orin Nano and running VSLAM algorithm to build a map of the environment in less than 30 seconds. Delivers value by showing real-time spatial understanding.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Jetson Orin Nano with RealSense D435i connected, **When** student deploys Isaac ROS VSLAM, **Then** 3D map is built in under 30 seconds
2. **Given** pre-built map from VSLAM, **When** student runs Nav2 for bipedal navigation, **Then** robot successfully navigates to specified waypoints

---

### User Story 3 - Generate Synthetic Training Data (Priority: P3)

Student wants to generate 5,000 labeled synthetic images in under 30 minutes using Isaac Sim for training perception models.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the synthetic data generation capabilities that are crucial for training robust perception systems without requiring expensive real-world data collection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running Isaac Sim's synthetic data generation pipeline and measuring the number of labeled images produced within 30 minutes. Delivers value by showing how to create training datasets for perception models.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Isaac Sim environment with humanoid and objects, **When** student runs synthetic data generation pipeline, **Then** 5,000 labeled images are generated within 30 minutes
2. **Given** generated synthetic images, **When** student reviews the labeling quality, **Then** images contain accurate bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and class labels

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the GPU memory is insufficient for running Isaac Sim at 60+ FPS?
- How does the system handle RealSense D435i camera disconnection during VSLAM operation?
- What occurs when synthetic data generation is interrupted and needs to resume?
