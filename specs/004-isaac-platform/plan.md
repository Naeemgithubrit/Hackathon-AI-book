# Implementation Plan: Isaac Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform)

**Branch**: `004-isaac-platform` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [specs/004-isaac-platform/spec.md](specs/004-isaac-platform/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-isaac-platform/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Documentation module teaching students to use NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025 + Isaac ROS for GPU-accelerated perception, VSLAM, navigation, and synthetic data generation on Jetson Orin. Based on research, we'll use Isaac Sim 2025 for optimal performance (≥60 FPS), cuVSLAM for rapid map building (<30 sec), and optimized synthetic data pipelines to generate 5,000 images in <30 minutes. The solution includes Docker configurations for both workstation and Jetson deployment with Mermaid diagrams for system visualization.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.10+, C++, ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill, Isaac Sim 2025.x
**Primary Dependencies**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025, Isaac ROS, ROS 2 Humble, RealSense D435i drivers, Nav2, cuVSLAM, DetectNet, Gazebo, Docker
**Storage**: File-based (Markdown docs, URDF models, synthetic datasets, Docker images)
**Testing**: Performance benchmarks (FPS, map build time, image generation rate), functional tests for ROS 2 nodes
**Target Platform**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, RTX 4070 Ti (workstation), NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
**Project Type**: Documentation/tutorials with code examples and Docker configurations
**Performance Goals**: ≥60 FPS in Isaac Sim, <30 sec map build with VSLAM, 5,000 images in <30 min synthetic generation
**Constraints**: <50 MB total assets size, CC0 licensing, Dockerfiles for both workstation and Jetson, 40-50 pages total
**Scale/Scope**: 4 Markdown documentation modules, synthetic dataset generation, Docker deployment configurations

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Educational Clarity Gate
✅ Content will guide learners progressively through Isaac Sim basics → perception/VSLAM → navigation/synthetic data
✅ Complex topics will be scaffolded with prerequisite knowledge (Module 03 Gazebo completion required)

### Engineering Accuracy Gate
✅ All content will reflect current NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2025 and Isaac ROS standards
✅ Technical claims will be verifiable against NVIDIA official documentation

### Practical Applicability Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
✅ Every concept will translate into executable, hands-on implementation
✅ Code examples will be runnable with specified dependencies (Isaac Sim 2025, ROS 2 Humble, Jetson Orin Nano)

### Spec-Driven Development Gate
✅ Content is driven by the approved spec file in `/specs/004-isaac-platform/spec.md`
✅ All changes will be reflected back to the spec as needed

### Ethical Responsibility Gate
✅ Content will include safety guidelines for physical robot deployment
✅ VSLAM and navigation systems will include risk mitigation guidance

### Reproducibility & Open Knowledge Gate
✅ All documentation, code examples, and Docker configurations will be reproducible
✅ Dependency versions will be specified, environment setup documented
✅ Repository will remain publicly accessible with CC0 licensing

### Zero Broken State Gate
✅ Repository will build successfully with all 4 Markdown files
✅ All links and examples will be validated before merge
