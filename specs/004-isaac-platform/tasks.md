# Implementation Tasks: Isaac Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform)

**Feature**: Isaac Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform)
**Branch**: `004-isaac-platform`
**Total Tasks**: 15
**Duration**: 15-30 min each

## Phase 1: Intro & Setup (3 tasks)

**Goal**: Set up documentation structure and basic prerequisites

- [X] T001 Create docs/module-04/ directory structure and placeholder files for all 4 modules
- [X] T002 [P] Create Mermaid diagram for Isaac Sim ↔ ROS 2 ↔ Jetson data flow in static/diagrams/
- [X] T003 [P] Write introductory content for docs/module-04/intro.md with learning goals and prerequisites

## Phase 2: Isaac Sim + ROS 2 Bridge (4 tasks)

**Goal**: Implement Isaac Sim basics with ROS 2 bridge achieving ≥60 FPS with humanoid

**Independent Test**: Student can launch Isaac Sim + ROS 2 bridge with humanoid achieving ≥60 FPS within 10 minutes

- [X] T004 [US1] Set up Isaac Sim 2025 environment with proper rendering settings for ≥60 FPS performance
- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Load humanoid robot model compatible with ROS 2 bridge and Isaac Sim
- [X] T006 [P] [US1] Configure ROS 2 bridge with proper topic mappings for Isaac Sim ↔ ROS 2 communication
- [X] T007 [US1] Validate FPS performance and create documentation for docs/module-04/isaac-sim-basics.md

## Phase 3: Perception Gems + Jetson Deployment (4 tasks)

**Goal**: Deploy Isaac ROS VSLAM and perception tools on Jetson with RealSense D435i

**Independent Test**: Student can deploy Isaac ROS VSLAM on Jetson and build map in <30 seconds

- [X] T008 [US2] Set up Jetson Orin Nano with Isaac ROS dependencies and RealSense D435i drivers
- [X] T009 [P] [US2] Configure cuVSLAM for rapid map building (<30 sec) with RealSense D435i input
- [X] T010 [P] [US2] Implement Isaac ROS perception gems (DetectNet, PeopleSegNet) on Jetson
- [X] T011 [US2] Document perception and VSLAM setup in docs/module-04/perception-and-vslam.md

## Phase 4: Nav2, Synthetic Data & Final Validation (4 tasks)

**Goal**: Implement Nav2 for bipedal navigation and synthetic data generation

**Independent Test**: Student can generate 5,000 labeled synthetic images in <30 minutes

- [X] T012 [US3] Configure Nav2 for bipedal robot navigation with proper costmaps and behavior trees
- [X] T013 [P] [US3] Implement synthetic data generation pipeline for 5,000+ labeled images in <30 min
- [X] T014 [P] [US3] Create Dockerfiles for workstation (Isaac Sim) and Jetson deployment scenarios
- [X] T015 [US3] Final validation of all acceptance criteria and complete docs/module-04/nav2-and-synthetic-data.md

## Dependencies

- T004, T005, T006 depend on T001 (basic structure must exist)
- T008 depends on proper Jetson setup
- T009, T010 depend on T008 (Jetson environment ready)
- T012, T013 depend on perception systems working
- T015 depends on all previous tasks completion

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Phase 1**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel after T001
- **Phase 2**: T005 and T006 can run in parallel after T004
- **Phase 3**: T009 and T010 can run in parallel after T008
- **Phase 4**: T013 and T014 can run in parallel after T012

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 to deliver Isaac Sim + ROS 2 bridge with humanoid at ≥60 FPS (US1)

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. MVP: Tasks T001-T007 (Isaac Sim basics with ROS 2 bridge)
2. P2 features: Tasks T008-T011 (VSLAM and perception on Jetson)
3. P3 features: Tasks T012-T015 (Navigation and synthetic data)
4. Final validation: Task T015
