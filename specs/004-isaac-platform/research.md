# Research Summary: Isaac Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform)

## Decision: Isaac Sim 2025.x vs 2024.x

**Rationale**: Isaac Sim 2025 is the latest version with enhanced GPU-accelerated simulation capabilities, improved ROS 2 bridge performance, and better support for humanoid robots. It includes cuVSLAM integration and optimized synthetic data generation pipelines that directly support the performance goals (≥60 FPS).

**Alternatives considered**:
- Isaac Sim 2024.x: Missing newer optimization features and some humanoid-specific enhancements
- Isaac Sim 2023.x: Significant performance limitations and limited ROS 2 Humble support

## Decision: Hardware Requirements and Performance Optimization

**Rationale**: RTX 4070 Ti meets the ≥60 FPS requirement for Isaac Sim with humanoid models. Jetson Orin Nano provides sufficient compute for VSLAM and Nav2 processing while maintaining compatibility with Isaac ROS. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ensures long-term support and compatibility with ROS 2 Humble.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Lower-end GPUs: Would not meet 60+ FPS requirement
- Alternative Jetson models: Orin Nano offers the best price/performance for this application

## Decision: Docker Configuration Strategy

**Rationale**: Separate Dockerfiles for workstation and Jetson ensure optimized deployment for each platform. Workstation Dockerfile can include Isaac Sim and full development tools, while Jetson Dockerfile focuses on runtime efficiency and VSLAM/Nav2 capabilities.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single universal Dockerfile: Would be too large and inefficient for Jetson deployment
- No Docker: Would complicate environment setup and reduce reproducibility

## Decision: Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline

**Rationale**: Isaac Sim's built-in synthetic data generation tools can produce 5,000+ labeled images within 30 minutes when properly configured with optimized scene complexity and batch processing. This meets the performance requirement while maintaining high-quality annotations.

**Alternatives considered**:
- External synthetic data tools: Would require additional integration and may not match Isaac Sim's native quality
- Real-world data collection: Time-consuming, expensive, and lacks the controlled environment benefits

## Decision: Mermaid Diagram for Data Flow

**Rationale**: Visual representation of the Isaac Sim ↔ ROS 2 ↔ Jetson data flow will clarify the architecture for students and help them understand how components interact in both simulation and real-world deployment.

**Data Flow Components**:
- Isaac Sim: Generates synthetic sensor data, simulates humanoid robot
- ROS 2 Bridge: Transports sensor data and control commands
- Jetson: Processes real sensor data, runs VSLAM and Nav2
- RealSense D435i: Provides depth and color data for perception
