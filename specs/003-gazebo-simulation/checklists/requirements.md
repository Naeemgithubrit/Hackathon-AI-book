# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 02 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Details:

**Content Quality**:
- Specification focuses on WHAT (learning outcomes, simulation capabilities, learner skills) not HOW (no content authoring implementation details)
- Written from educator/learner perspective, focused on educational value and practical simulation skills
- All mandatory sections completed: 4 user stories, 12 functional requirements, 8 success criteria, plus key entities, assumptions, out of scope, dependencies, and constraints

**Requirement Completeness**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements clear and actionable
- All 12 functional requirements testable (e.g., FR-004 requires "ready-to-use CC0 or original apartment assets," FR-009 specifies "≥1.0x real-time factor on RTX 4070 Ti+," FR-012 requires validation on target hardware)
- Success criteria include specific metrics: "85% of learners," "within 2 hours," "100% of sensor data," "≥1.0x real-time factor," "80% successfully set up," "60-75 pages," "75% can diagnose"
- Success criteria are learner-outcome focused (e.g., SC-001 focuses on learner capability to spawn and control robots, not internal module structure)
- 16 acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories (4 per P1 story, 4 per P2 story)
- Four edge cases with mitigation strategies
- Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" (8 explicitly excluded topics)
- Dependencies and assumptions documented in dedicated sections

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each of 12 functional requirements maps to user stories and success criteria
- Four user stories (P1: Humanoid Simulation, P1: Environment Creation, P2: Unity Visualization, P2: Performance Optimization) cover complete simulation workflow
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-008 provide measurable validation for all functional requirements
- Specification maintains abstraction: focuses on module learning objectives (what capabilities learners gain) without prescribing implementation approach (how content is authored)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements clear and well-scoped
- Technical terms (Gazebo, Unity, URDF, LiDAR, ROS 2, RTX 4070 Ti) intentionally referenced as subject matter
- Real-time performance requirement (≥1.0x real-time factor) is critical constraint that will need careful testing during implementation
- CC0 asset requirement (FR-004, SC-007) ensures legal compliance and reproducibility
- Unity limited to visualization/HRI (FR-008) maintains focus and prevents scope creep into ML training
