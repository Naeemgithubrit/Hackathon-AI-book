## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Launch Sensor-Equipped Humanoid in Gazebo (Priority: P1)

As a student who has completed Module 01 (ROS 2), I want to quickly launch a fully sensor-equipped humanoid robot in Gazebo simulation so that I can start experimenting with sensor data and control algorithms without spending time on setup.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other learning activities. Students need to see immediate results to maintain engagement and motivation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following the setup instructions and launching the humanoid with all sensors operational within 10 minutes, demonstrating that the simulation environment is properly configured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a properly configured ROS 2 environment, **When** student follows the launch instructions, **Then** a humanoid robot with depth camera, LiDAR, IMU, and contact sensors appears in Gazebo within 10 minutes
2. **Given** the humanoid is running in simulation, **When** student subscribes to sensor topics, **Then** they receive live sensor data streams from all sensors

### User Story 2 - Build Realistic Apartment Environment (Priority: P2)

As a student learning simulation, I want to build a complete apartment environment with kitchen, living room, and obstacles so that I can practice navigation and manipulation tasks in a realistic setting.

**Why this priority**: Realistic environments are essential for meaningful robotics practice and help students understand how robots interact with the real world.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by building the apartment environment and verifying that it includes kitchen, living room, and obstacle elements that can be used for navigation and interaction exercises.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the simulation environment is set up, **When** student follows environment creation instructions, **Then** a complete apartment with kitchen and living room sections is created
2. **Given** the apartment environment exists, **When** student attempts navigation tasks, **Then** obstacles provide realistic challenges for path planning algorithms

### User Story 3 - Connect Unity for Real-time Visualization (Priority: P3)

As a student who wants enhanced visualization, I want to optionally connect Unity for beautiful real-time visualization so that I can see high-quality rendering of the simulation for better understanding and presentation purposes.

**Why this priority**: While not essential for core functionality, Unity visualization provides enhanced learning experience and professional presentation capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting Unity visualization bridge and observing enhanced rendering of the simulation environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Gazebo simulation is running, **When** student connects Unity visualization, **Then** high-quality real-time rendering of the simulation is displayed
2. **Given** Unity visualization is connected, **When** robot moves in Gazebo, **Then** the same movement is reflected in Unity with high-quality rendering

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the simulation runs on hardware below the minimum requirements (RTX 4070 Ti)?
- How does the system handle sensor configuration conflicts or sensor data overload?
- What occurs when Unity connection fails or is unstable?
