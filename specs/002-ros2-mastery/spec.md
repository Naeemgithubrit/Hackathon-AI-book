# Feature Specification: Module 01 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Feature Branch**: `002-ros2-mastery`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Module 01 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Target audience: Learners who know Python but have zero ROS 2 experience. Focus: Master ROS 2 as the universal middleware for all modern robots"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - ROS 2 Workspace Creation & Multi-Node Development (Priority: P1)

A Python developer with zero ROS 2 experience wants to create their first ROS 2 workspace, understand the package structure, and build a multi-node system where nodes communicate via topics and services.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational skill for all ROS 2 development. Without workspace mastery, learners cannot progress to more advanced robotics concepts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having learners create a new ROS 2 workspace from scratch, implement at least two communicating nodes (publisher/subscriber), build the workspace, and run the system successfully within 20 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean Ubuntu 22.04 system with ROS 2 installed, **When** a learner follows workspace creation instructions, **Then** they can create, build, and source a new workspace in under 5 minutes
2. **Given** a ROS 2 workspace, **When** a learner creates a publisher node and a subscriber node, **Then** messages flow correctly between nodes as verified by terminal output
3. **Given** build errors or runtime issues, **When** a learner applies debugging techniques from the module, **Then** they can identify and resolve the issue within 15 minutes

---

### User Story 2 - Robot Modeling with URDF/Xacro & Visualization (Priority: P1)

A learner wants to model a humanoid or any articulated robot using URDF/Xacro, understand joint hierarchies and transforms, and visualize the robot model in RViz to validate the design before simulation.

**Why this priority**: Robot modeling is essential for simulation and control. URDF/Xacro mastery is a prerequisite for all subsequent simulation work in Gazebo and Isaac Sim.

**Independent Test**: Learner creates a multi-link robot model (minimum 6 joints for humanoid: torso, 2 arms, 2 legs, head) from scratch using URDF/Xacro, launches RViz, and can manipulate joint states to verify kinematic correctness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** URDF/Xacro syntax knowledge, **When** a learner models a simple 2-link robot, **Then** the model loads in RViz without errors and joint transforms are correct
2. **Given** a humanoid robot template, **When** a learner modifies link dimensions and joint limits, **Then** changes are reflected in RViz visualization immediately upon reload
3. **Given** a complex robot with multiple kinematic chains, **When** the learner uses Xacro macros for repetitive structures, **Then** the model is maintainable and generates valid URDF

---

### User Story 3 - Progressive Hands-On Projects for Skill Building (Priority: P1)

A learner wants to progressively build practical skills through at least 8 complete projects that increase in complexity, from basic pub/sub to multi-node robotic systems with URDF integration.

**Why this priority**: Hands-on projects are the primary learning mechanism. Without progressively complex exercises, theoretical knowledge doesn't translate to practical capability.

**Independent Test**: Learner completes all 8 projects sequentially, with each project building on previous concepts. All projects pass automated tests (colcon test) with zero errors/warnings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** project 1 (basic publisher/subscriber), **When** a learner completes the implementation, **Then** colcon test passes and the system demonstrates correct message flow
2. **Given** project 4 (service-based request/response), **When** a learner implements client and server nodes, **Then** the system handles multiple concurrent requests correctly
3. **Given** project 8 (URDF + multi-node control system), **When** a learner integrates robot model with control nodes, **Then** the complete system runs in RViz with real-time joint control

---

### User Story 4 - Automated Testing & Code Quality Validation (Priority: P2)

A learner wants to understand how to write and run automated tests for ROS 2 packages, ensuring their code meets quality standards before deployment or submission.

**Why this priority**: Testing is essential for professional robotics development but can be learned after core ROS 2 concepts. It's critical for building reliable systems but not blocking for initial learning.

**Independent Test**: Learner adds unit tests and integration tests to their ROS 2 package, runs colcon test, interprets test output, and achieves 100% pass rate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a ROS 2 package with nodes, **When** a learner writes unit tests for message handling, **Then** tests execute successfully via colcon test
2. **Given** test failures, **When** a learner reads test output and error messages, **Then** they can identify the root cause and fix the code within 10 minutes
3. **Given** all provided code examples, **When** running colcon test across all 8 projects, **Then** zero errors and zero warnings are reported

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a learner's ROS 2 environment has conflicting packages or incorrect sourcing? (Provide troubleshooting flowchart for common environment issues)
- How does a learner handle URDF syntax errors that prevent model loading? (Include validation tools and common error patterns with fixes)
- What if a learner's workspace won't build due to dependency issues? (Document rosdep usage and dependency resolution strategies)
- How does a learner debug nodes that fail silently or produce no output? (Provide systematic debugging checklist: check topic names, message types, QoS settings, etc.)
