# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 01 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Details:

**Content Quality**:
- Specification focuses on WHAT (learning outcomes, module goals, learner capabilities) not HOW (no mention of content authoring implementation, internal course structure)
- Written from educator/learner perspective, focused on educational value and skill acquisition
- All three mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with comprehensive detail including 4 user stories and 12 functional requirements

**Requirement Completeness**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear and actionable
- All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 specifies "at least 8 complete projects," FR-008 requires "colcon test with zero errors/warnings," FR-009 defines "≤3 non-standard apt dependencies")
- Success criteria include specific metrics: "90% of learners," "under 20 minutes," "85% on first attempt," "100% pass colcon test," "70-90 pages," "16 hours total"
- Success criteria are learner-facing and technology-agnostic in describing outcomes (e.g., SC-001 focuses on workspace creation time, not internal module structure details)
- Four comprehensive user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios (12 total scenarios)
- Four edge cases identified with mitigation strategies
- Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section (8 explicitly excluded topics)
- Dependencies and assumptions documented in dedicated sections

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each of the 12 functional requirements maps to user stories and success criteria
- Four user stories (P1: Workspace Creation, P1: URDF/Xacro Modeling, P1: Progressive Projects, P2: Automated Testing) cover the complete learning journey
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-008 provide measurable validation for all functional requirements
- Specification maintains abstraction: focuses on module content requirements (what must be taught/included) without prescribing implementation approach (how to structure internally, how to write content)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and well-scoped
- Technical terms (ROS 2, URDF, Xacro, RViz, colcon, rclpy) are intentionally referenced because these are the SUBJECT MATTER of the educational content, not implementation details of how to build the module
- The 8 hands-on projects requirement (FR-003) is a concrete, measurable constraint that will need detailed planning in the implementation phase
- All 8 projects must include automated tests (FR-010) which ensures quality validation for learner work
