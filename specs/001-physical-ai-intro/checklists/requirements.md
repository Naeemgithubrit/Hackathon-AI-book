
# Specification Quality Checklist: Introduction & Physical AI Foundations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Details:

**Content Quality**:
- Specification focuses on WHAT (chapter goals, learning outcomes, user needs) not HOW (no mention of implementation specifics like code structure or internal APIs)
- Written from learner/educator perspective, focused on educational value
- All three mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with comprehensive detail

**Requirement Completeness**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear and actionable
- All 10 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 specifies "copy-paste functional," FR-004 requires "exact component models and prices")
- Success criteria include specific metrics: "90% of readers," "under 4 hours," "95% of commands," "100% of links"
- Success criteria are user-facing and technology-agnostic (e.g., SC-002 focuses on setup time, not internal tooling details)
- Three comprehensive user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- Four edge cases identified with mitigation strategies
- Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions documented in dedicated sections

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each of the 10 functional requirements maps to user stories and success criteria
- Three user stories (P1: Value Proposition, P1: Hardware Setup, P2: Hardware Planning) cover the complete learning journey
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-008 provide measurable validation for all functional requirements
- Specification maintains abstraction: focuses on chapter content requirements (what must be included) without prescribing implementation approach (how to write/structure internally)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and well-scoped
- Hardware specifications (FR-004, FR-005) intentionally reference specific technologies (Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble, Isaac Sim, RTX GPUs) because these are the SUBJECT MATTER of the educational content, not implementation details of how to build the chapter
