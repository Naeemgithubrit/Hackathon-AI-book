## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Maximize Parallelism (3 developers)

**Developer 1 - US1 (Value Proposition)**:
```bash
# After Phase 1-2 complete
T008 → T010 → T014 (partial for index.md)
T009 → T011 → T014 (partial for four-pillars.md)
```

**Developer 2 - US2 (Hardware Setup)**:
```bash
# After Phase 1-2 complete
T015 → T019
T016 → T020
T017 → T018 → T021 → T022
```

**Developer 3 - US3 (Hardware Budget) + Shared**:
```bash
# During Phase 2
T005, T006, T007 (parallel)
# After Phase 2
T023 → T024, T025, T026
T012, T013 (support US1)
```

### Example 2: Solo Developer (Sequential)

```bash
# Day 1: Setup + Foundational + US1
T001, T002, T003, T004  # 60 min
T005, T006, T007        # 45 min (parallel if tools support)
T008 → T010 → T009 → T011 → T012 → T013 → T014  # 90 min

# Day 2: US2 + US3
T015 → T019, T016 → T020, T017 → T018 → T021 → T022  # 120 min
T023 → T024, T025, T026  # 45 min

# Day 3: Polish

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (User Story 1 Only)

For minimum viable deliverable, implement **only Phase 1-3**:
- Setup (T001-T004)
- Foundational (T005-T007)
- User Story 1 (T008-T014)

**MVP Deliverables**:
- 3 pages (index.md, four-pillars-architecture.md, repository-structure.md)
- 2 diagrams (4 Pillars, repo structure)
- 15 curated references documented

**Testing**: Reader can understand Physical AI value proposition and articulate 3 humanoid advantages.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1** (MVP): US1 complete → deploy for early feedback
2. **Sprint 2**: Add US2 (Hardware Setup) → readers can follow installation
3. **Sprint 3**: Add US3 (Hardware Budget) → readers can plan procurement
4. **Sprint 4**: Polish → production-ready with zero broken links
