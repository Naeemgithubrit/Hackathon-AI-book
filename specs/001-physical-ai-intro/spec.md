# Feature Specification: Introduction & Physical AI Foundations

**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-intro`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Introduction & Physical AI Foundations - Target audience: Intermediate-to-advanced AI engineers transitioning from digital agents to embodied intelligence. Focus: Why Physical AI and humanoid robotics are the ultimate frontier of applied AI in 2025–2030"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understanding Physical AI Value Proposition (Priority: P1)

An intermediate AI engineer with experience in LLMs and digital agents wants to understand why physical AI and humanoid robotics represent the next frontier, and whether this field is worth investing their learning time and career focus.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational motivation chapter. Without understanding the "why," readers won't commit to the technical depth required in subsequent chapters.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having readers articulate (written or verbal) three specific advantages of humanoid form factors in human-designed environments and explain one real-world application where Physical AI outperforms digital-only AI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader has completed Chapter 1, **When** asked to explain why humanoid robots are optimal for human environments, **Then** they can articulate at least three architectural advantages (e.g., navigating stairs, manipulating human-designed tools, social acceptance)
2. **Given** a reader reviews the 2025-2030 timeline content, **When** evaluating career opportunities, **Then** they can identify at least two market segments where Physical AI is creating new job roles
3. **Given** comparison examples between digital agents and embodied agents, **When** analyzing task requirements, **Then** the reader can correctly classify which tasks require physical embodiment vs. digital-only solutions

### User Story 2 - Hardware Setup & Environment Configuration (Priority: P1)

A reader with a capable workstation or laptop wants to set up a complete development environment for Physical AI experimentation, including operating system, simulation tools, and verification that everything works correctly before proceeding to later chapters.

**Why this priority**: This is blocking for all subsequent hands-on chapters. Without a working environment, readers cannot execute any code examples or experiments.

**Independent Test**: Reader successfully runs a "hello world" simulation (e.g., spawn a simple robot in Isaac Sim or Gazebo, verify ROS 2 nodes communicate) and can demonstrate all core tools launch without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader has hardware meeting minimum requirements, **When** following installation instructions step-by-step, **Then** Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble, and Isaac Sim 2024.x/2025 are installed and verified within 4 hours
2. **Given** the development environment is configured, **When** running the provided verification script, **Then** all dependencies pass checks and a simple test simulation renders without crashes
3. **Given** installation commands are copy-pasted from the chapter, **When** executed on a clean Ubuntu 22.04 system, **Then** zero command-line errors occur and all tools launch successfully

---

### User Story 3 - Hardware Budget & Configuration Planning (Priority: P2)

A reader or organization needs to make an informed purchasing decision about Physical AI development hardware, understanding the trade-offs between budget tiers and what capabilities each tier unlocks.

**Why this priority**: While not blocking for learning (readers can use cloud or borrowed resources initially), hardware decisions involve significant financial investment and should be informed early.

**Independent Test**: Reader can create a justified hardware procurement proposal with specific GPU, CPU, RAM, and storage specifications that maps to their learning goals and budget constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the 2025 hardware matrix with tested configurations, **When** a reader evaluates their budget, **Then** they can select an appropriate tier (entry/mid/high-end) and understand which simulations and model sizes it supports
2. **Given** exact prices and vendor links for components, **When** creating a purchase list, **Then** the reader can assemble a complete parts list within their budget that meets minimum requirements
3. **Given** benchmark data for RTX 4070 Ti / 4080 / 4090 laptops, **When** comparing configurations, **Then** the reader can predict simulation performance and identify potential bottlenecks

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a reader has a Mac or Windows-only machine and cannot install Ubuntu natively? (Document dual-boot, VM, or cloud alternatives with performance trade-offs)
- How does the setup process differ for ARM-based systems (e.g., Jetson for later sim-to-real chapters)? (Note: defer detailed Jetson setup to Chapter 13, provide forward reference)
- What if a reader's hardware is below minimum specs but they want to start learning anyway? (Provide degraded-experience path: cloud alternatives, simpler simulations, or theoretical-only study with code review)
- What if external links for hardware vendors or documentation go dead? (All links must include Wayback Machine or archive.is snapshots as per book constraints)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-004**: Chapter MUST define minimum, recommended, and optimal hardware specifications with exact component models and prices (2025 pricing)
- **FR-005**: Chapter MUST include a hardware compatibility matrix showing which configurations have been tested and validated
- **FR-006**: Chapter MUST provide a verification procedure readers can run to confirm their environment is correctly configured
- **FR-007**: Chapter MUST limit prerequisites to intermediate-to-advanced AI engineers (post-LLM/agent engineering experience) and explicitly exclude beginner Linux/Python tutorials
- **FR-008**: Chapter MUST exclude historical robotics content before 2020 and focus only on modern Physical AI (2020-2030)
