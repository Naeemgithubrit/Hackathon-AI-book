# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Chatbot Authentication with Better Auth

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Validation Notes

1. **Content Quality**:
   - The spec avoids implementation details (no mention of specific Better Auth APIs, Python code, React components)
   - Focus is on WHAT users need (personalized chat experience) and WHY (tailored learning based on expertise)
   - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints) are complete

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (all requirements are well-defined)
   - Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-018) is testable with clear acceptance criteria
   - Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, boolean outcomes)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not system internals)
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format for all user stories
   - Edge cases section identifies 8 specific scenarios
   - Scope clearly defines In Scope (12 items) and Out of Scope (8 items)
   - Dependencies (6 items) and Assumptions (10 items) are documented

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - User scenarios cover all primary flows: new user registration (P1), returning user signin (P2), guest restriction (P3)
   - Success criteria directly measure the measurable outcomes defined in the spec
   - No implementation leakage detected (Better Auth is mentioned as a constraint/dependency, not as implementation detail in requirements)

## Notes

- The specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- Open Questions section identifies 5 items for future consideration, but they do not block MVP development
- All edge cases can be addressed during implementation planning phase
- Risk mitigation strategies are documented for 4 key risks
