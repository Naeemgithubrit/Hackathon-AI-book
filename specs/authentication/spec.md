# Feature Specification: RAG Chatbot Authentication with Better Auth

**Feature Branch**: `authentication`
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "RAG Chatbot Authentication with Better Auth - Implement Signup and Signin using Better Auth. At signup, ask custom questions about the user's software and hardware background. Store this background information in Better Auth user profile/metadata. Use this background to personalize the RAG chatbot responses."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-15

- Q: Should all background questions (programming experience, ROS 2 familiarity, hardware access) be mandatory during signup, or can users skip some? → A: All fields required - users must answer all background questions to complete signup
- Q: How should the system respond when a user tries to sign up with an email that's already registered? → A: Show error "Email already registered. Try signing in instead." with a link to the sign-in form
- Q: How should the system handle session expiration when a user is actively using the chat widget? → A: Allow current message to be typed; show re-authentication prompt when user tries to send; preserve typed message after re-login
- Q: What should the default session duration be for authenticated users? → A: 7 days - users must re-authenticate weekly
- Q: What specific input format should be used for collecting programming experience? → A: Dropdown with predefined ranges - "0-2 years", "3-5 years", "6-10 years", "10+ years"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Registration with Personalized Profile (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the documentation site, wants to use the RAG chatbot, creates an account by providing their background information, and immediately experiences personalized chatbot responses tailored to their expertise level.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - personalized learning experience from the first interaction. Without this, the feature provides no differentiation from anonymous chat.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new account with different background profiles (beginner vs. expert) and observing that the chatbot's first response adjusts its language and depth accordingly. Delivers immediate personalization value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest user on the documentation site, **When** they click "Sign Up" on the chat widget, **Then** they see a registration form with email, password, and background questions
2. **Given** a user on the signup form, **When** they fill in all required fields (email, password, years of programming experience, ROS 2 familiarity level, hardware access), **Then** their account is created and they are automatically signed in
3. **Given** a newly registered beginner user (0-2 years experience, no ROS 2 knowledge), **When** they ask "What is ROS 2?", **Then** the chatbot response uses simple language, step-by-step explanations, and avoids jargon
4. **Given** a newly registered expert user (5+ years experience, advanced ROS 2 knowledge), **When** they ask "What is ROS 2?", **Then** the chatbot response uses technical terminology, focuses on advanced concepts, and provides in-depth details

### User Story 2 - Returning User Authentication (Priority: P2)

A registered user returns to the documentation site, signs in with their existing credentials, and the RAG chatbot immediately provides personalized responses based on their saved background profile without needing to re-enter any information.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user retention and consistent personalized experience. Users should not lose their personalization settings across sessions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an account, logging out, logging back in, and verifying that chatbot personalization persists. Delivers continuity of personalized experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing registered user, **When** they click "Sign In" on the chat widget, **Then** they see a login form with email and password fields
2. **Given** a user on the signin form, **When** they enter correct credentials and submit, **Then** they are authenticated and the chat widget opens
3. **Given** an authenticated user with a saved background profile, **When** they ask any question to the RAG chatbot, **Then** the response is personalized based on their stored expertise level and hardware context
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they close and reopen the browser (session persistence), **Then** they remain signed in and chatbot personalization continues

### User Story 3 - Guest User Restriction (Priority: P3)

A guest user (not authenticated) visits the documentation site and attempts to use the RAG chatbot. The system prompts them to sign in or sign up to access the personalized chat feature.

**Why this priority**: Necessary for access control and to encourage registration, but lower priority than the core personalization flows. Can function as a soft gate to drive user registration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the chat widget while logged out and verifying that it displays a sign-in prompt instead of allowing chat. Delivers clear call-to-action for registration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest user (not signed in), **When** they try to open the chat widget, **Then** they see a message "Please sign in to use the personalized chat" with Sign In and Sign Up buttons
2. **Given** a guest user viewing the sign-in prompt, **When** they click "Sign Up", **Then** they are taken to the registration flow (User Story 1)
3. **Given** a guest user viewing the sign-in prompt, **When** they click "Sign In", **Then** they are taken to the login flow (User Story 2)

### Edge Cases

- When a user enters an already-registered email during signup, the system displays error message "Email already registered. Try signing in instead." with a clickable link to the sign-in form
- How does the system handle invalid email formats?
- What happens if a user forgets their password?
- All background questions are required; users cannot submit signup form without completing all fields (programming experience, ROS 2 familiarity, hardware access)
- When the Better Auth session expires during an active chat, the system allows the user to continue typing their current message; when the user attempts to send, a re-authentication prompt appears; after successful re-login, the typed message is preserved and can be sent
- How does the system handle network failures during authentication?
- What happens if a user updates their background profile after registration?
- How does the system handle very long or malformed input in background questions?

- Network connectivity is stable during authentication flows
- Users will provide truthful background information (no verification against actual skill level)
- The personalization logic will be implemented in the RAG agent layer, not in Better Auth itself
- Programming experience ranges ("0-2 years", "3-5 years", "6-10 years", "10+ years") map to expertise levels for personalization (0-2 = beginner, 3-5 = intermediate, 6-10 = advanced, 10+ = expert)

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

- Better Auth library (external dependency, must be installed and configured)
- Existing FastAPI backend with uv environment (must support Better Auth integration)
- Existing Docusaurus frontend with React components (must support authentication UI)
- Existing RAG agent (docs_agent) (must support dynamic system prompt injection)
- SQLite database (for Better Auth user and session storage)
- Context7 MCP server for retrieving Better Auth documentation and integration examples

## Constraints *(mandatory)*

- Must use Better Auth as the authentication library (requirement specified in user input)
- Must integrate with existing FastAPI backend without major architectural changes
- Must integrate with existing Docusaurus frontend without disrupting current documentation site functionality
- Must use SQLite for hackathon (production can migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL later)
- Must not expose sensitive user data (passwords, email) in chat logs or RAG agent context
- Background questions must be answered during signup only (not iteratively updated during this phase)
- Personalization must be transparent to users (they should understand why responses differ)
- Authentication UI must be accessible from the existing chat widget interface

## Non-Functional Requirements *(optional - include if relevant)*

### Performance

- Authentication operations (signup, signin) must complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- User background data retrieval must add no more than 500ms latency to chat requests
- Session validation must add no more than 100ms overhead to each authenticated request

### Security

- Passwords must be hashed using Better Auth's secure hashing mechanisms (bcrypt or Argon2)
- Session tokens must be cryptographically secure and unpredictable
- User background data must not be exposed in client-side logs or network responses outside authenticated contexts
- SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities must be prevented through parameterized queries and input sanitization

### Usability

- Signup and signin forms must be intuitive and require no technical knowledge to complete
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable (e.g., "Email already registered. Try signing in instead.")
- Background questions must include helpful descriptions/tooltips explaining what each field means
- Chat widget must clearly indicate authentication status (signed in vs. guest)

### Reliability

- Authentication service must handle concurrent signup/signin requests without race conditions
- Session persistence must survive server restarts (sessions stored in database, not in-memory)
- Failed authentication attempts must not crash the application or expose stack traces to users

## Risks & Mitigations *(optional - include if relevant)*

### Risk 1: Better Auth Integration Complexity

**Description**: Better Auth may require complex configuration or be incompatible with FastAPI/Docusaurus setup.

**Mitigation**: Use Context7 MCP server to retrieve official Better Auth documentation and integration examples before implementation. Start with minimal configuration and expand incrementally.

### Risk 2: Personalization Not Noticeable

**Description**: Users may not perceive the difference in chatbot responses between expertise levels, reducing perceived value.

**Mitigation**: Design clear, testable personalization rules with distinct language/depth differences. Include examples in acceptance testing that demonstrate obvious contrast between beginner and expert responses.

### Risk 3: User Background Inaccuracy

**Description**: Users may provide inaccurate background information (e.g., claiming expert status when they're beginners), leading to mismatched personalization.

**Mitigation**: Accept this as a known limitation for MVP. In future iterations, adaptive personalization could adjust based on user interaction patterns. For now, trust user self-reporting.

### Risk 4: Session Management Conflicts

**Description**: Better Auth session management may conflict with existing in-memory session handling in the current system.

**Mitigation**: Fully replace in-memory sessions with Better Auth sessions. Ensure all endpoints use Better Auth session validation. Test session expiration and refresh flows thoroughly.

## Open Questions *(optional - include if relevant)*

- How should we handle users who want to update their background profile after registration?
- Should there be a visible indicator to users showing how their background affects chatbot responses?
- Should we log personalization decisions for analytics/debugging purposes?
