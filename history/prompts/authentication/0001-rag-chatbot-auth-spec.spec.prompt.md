## Prompt

RAG Chatbot Authentication with Better Auth

Create folder: specs/authentication/ only (no number prefix)

Tech stack (locked):
- Authentication: Better Auth[](https://www.better-auth.com/) — official library
- Backend: Existing FastAPI + uv environment
- Frontend: Docusaurus (existing) + React components
- Database: Better Auth default (SQLite for hackathon, production-ready)
- Session management: Better Auth sessions (replace current in-memory sessions)
- Use Context7 MCP server for:
  • Better Auth docs
  • FastAPI integration examples
  • Docusaurus auth UI patterns

Core goal:
Implement Signup and Signin using Better Auth.
At signup, ask custom questions about the user's software and hardware background (e.g., years of programming experience, familiarity with ROS 2, hardware access like robots/sensors).

Store this background information in Better Auth user profile/metadata.

Use this background to personalize the RAG chatbot responses:
- The RAG agent (docs_agent) will receive the user's background
- Example: If user is beginner → explain concepts simply, more step-by-step
- If user is advanced → use technical terms, deeper details
- Personalization happens by dynamically adjusting the system prompt/instructions of the RAG agent based on stored user background

User scenarios:
1. New user → clicks "Sign Up" → answers background questions → account created → logged in → chat widget opens with personalized responses based on their background
2. Existing user → "Sign In" → chat widget opens with personalized responses based on their saved background
3. Guest → chat widget shows "Please sign in to use the chat"

Functional requirements:
- Signup form with email/password + custom background questions
- Signin form with email/password
- Protected chat widget — only authenticated users can use it
- On every chat request, fetch user background from Better Auth and pass it to the RAG agent instructions
- Update RAG agent system prompt dynamically based on user background (e.g., "The user...")

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for RAG Chatbot Authentication with Better Auth in specs/authentication/spec.md.

Key deliverables:
1. **Specification Document**: Complete spec with 3 prioritized user stories (P1: New User Registration with Personalized Profile, P2: Returning User Authentication, P3: Guest User Restriction), 18 functional requirements, 8 measurable success criteria
2. **Quality Checklist**: Validated specification against 14 quality criteria - all PASSED
3. **Feature Structure**: Created specs/authentication/ directory (without number prefix as requested)

Specification highlights:
- User-focused requirements for personalized learning experience
- Clear acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Technology-agnostic success criteria (measurable user outcomes)
- Comprehensive edge cases (8 scenarios identified)
- Well-defined scope with 12 in-scope items and 8 out-of-scope items for future iterations
- 10 documented assumptions and 6 dependencies
- 4 risk mitigation strategies
- 5 open questions for future consideration

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification ready for planning phase. Establishes foundation for personalized RAG chatbot authentication with clear user value proposition and measurable success criteria.
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist validation completed - all 14 items PASSED. Acceptance scenarios defined for all 3 user stories.
- 📁 Files: Created 2 files - specs/authentication/spec.md (main specification), specs/authentication/checklists/requirements.md (quality validation)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to create architectural design, or /sp.clarify if additional requirements refinement needed
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic. Successfully balanced user requirements with implementation constraints (Better Auth requirement). Open Questions section captures 5 items for future consideration without blocking MVP.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Specification passed all quality checks on first iteration.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification Quality Checklist - PASS (14/14 items validated)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with custom directory structure (no number prefix)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan to validate architectural approach for Better Auth integration with FastAPI and Docusaurus
