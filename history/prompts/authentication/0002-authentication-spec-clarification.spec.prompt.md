## Prompt

/sp.clarify

(User requested clarification of the authentication specification to reduce ambiguity before planning phase)

## Response snapshot

Conducted structured ambiguity scan across 10 taxonomy categories and asked 5 critical clarification questions sequentially. All answers integrated into spec.md immediately after each response.

**Questions & Answers:**

1. **Background field requirements**: Should all background questions be mandatory or optional?
   - Answer: All fields required (Option A)
   - Impact: Updated FR-002a, Edge Cases section

2. **Duplicate email handling**: How should system respond to duplicate email signup attempts?
   - Answer: Show error "Email already registered. Try signing in instead." with link (Option A)
   - Impact: Updated FR-017, Edge Cases section

3. **Session expiration during chat**: How to handle session expiration when user is actively typing?
   - Answer: Allow typing current message, show re-auth prompt on send, preserve message (Option B)
   - Impact: Updated FR-016, Edge Cases section

4. **Session duration**: What should default session expiration time be?
   - Answer: 7 days (Option C)
   - Impact: Updated FR-015, Assumptions section, removed from Open Questions

5. **Programming experience format**: What input format for collecting programming experience?
   - Answer: Dropdown with ranges "0-2 years", "3-5 years", "6-10 years", "10+ years" (Option C)
   - Impact: Updated FR-002, Assumptions section with expertise level mapping

**Sections Updated:**
- Added new "Clarifications" section with Session 2025-12-15
- Resolved 3 edge case questions
- Updated 6 functional requirements (FR-002, FR-002a, FR-015, FR-016, FR-017, FR-018)
- Updated Assumptions (session duration, programming experience mapping)
- Removed 2 items from Open Questions (background field requirements, session duration)

**Coverage Summary:**
- 7/10 categories resolved to "Clear" or "Resolved" status
- 3 open questions remain but low impact on MVP (deferred to planning/implementation)
- Specification ready for /sp.plan

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Eliminated all critical ambiguities blocking architectural planning. Specification now has clear, testable requirements with specific UI controls, edge case handling, and measurable constraints.
- 🧪 Tests: Ambiguity coverage analysis completed across 10 taxonomy categories. All high-impact categories (Domain & Data Model, Interaction & UX Flow, Edge Cases) resolved.
- 📁 Files: Updated 1 file (specs/authentication/spec.md) with 5 clarifications integrated incrementally
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan (architectural design ready to begin)
- 🧠 Reflection: Sequential questioning with immediate integration worked well. User selected recommended options for 4/5 questions, indicating strong alignment between recommendations and project needs. Remaining open questions are low-impact polish items appropriately deferred.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All 5 clarifications integrated successfully on first attempt.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Ambiguity taxonomy coverage - PASS (7/10 categories resolved, 3 deferred with low impact)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Sequential questioning with recommended options and immediate integration
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate that clarified requirements (dropdown formats, session handling) are implementable with Better Auth during /sp.plan phase
