## Prompt

```text
Module 02 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Break into 5 phases, 22 atomic tasks total.
All code in separate public repo github.com/yourname/ros2-physical-ai-2025
All docs in /docs/module-01/

Phase 1 – Workspace & Basics (8 tasks)
Phase 2 – URDF & TF2 Mastery (6 tasks)
Phase 3 – Actions, Lifecycle, Real-time (4 tasks)
Phase 4 – Humanoid Navigation Stack (3 tasks)
Phase 5 – Validation & Packaging (1 task)

Every task must produce a working colcon package + README)

Acceptance examples:
- "talker/listener runs with zero warnings"
- "12-DoF humanoid URDF loads in RViz with correct TF tree in <10 sec"
- "navigation action server completes 10-meter goal 5/5 times"

Deliver as 002-ros2-mastery/(your files).md
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive tasks.md with 22 atomic tasks across 5 phases for Module 02 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2).

**Task Breakdown**:
- **Phase 1: Workspace & Basics** (8 tasks, 6 parallelizable)
  - T001: Create capstone repository structure (github.com/physical-ai/ros2-physical-ai-2025)
  - T002-T008: Docusaurus documentation + lab packages (talker/listener, custom messages, services)
  - All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P] [US#] Description with file path`

- **Phase 2: URDF & TF2 Mastery** (6 tasks, 4 parallelizable)
  - T009-T011: 5-DOF humanoid URDF design (torso + 2 arms with xacro macros)
  - T012-T014: TF2 coordinate frame broadcasting and documentation

- **Phase 3: Actions, Lifecycle, Real-time** (4 tasks, 3 parallelizable)
  - T015-T017: MoveArm action server/client with feedback
  - T018: Lifecycle and real-time executor documentation

- **Phase 4: Humanoid Navigation Stack** (3 tasks, 2 parallelizable)
  - T019: Upgrade to 12-DOF humanoid (add head + legs)
  - T020-T021: Launch files and debugging tools

- **Phase 5: Validation & Packaging** (1 task)
  - T022: Full integration test + GitHub release v1.0.0

**Key Features**:
- All 22 tasks have concrete acceptance criteria (e.g., "talker/listener runs with zero warnings", "12-DOF humanoid loads in RViz <10 sec")
- 15 tasks marked as parallelizable ([P] label)
- MVP scope defined: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (14 tasks) deliverable in Week 1
- Dependency graph and parallel execution examples included
- Quality gates: zero build warnings, all tests pass, copy-paste functional code

**Constraints Enforced**:
- Every task produces working colcon package + README
- Zero build warnings (`COLCON_LOG_LEVEL=warn colcon build`)
- Valid TF tree (`ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames`)
- Navigation action server completes 10-meter goal 5/5 times

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 22 atomic tasks created, organized by 5 phases with clear dependencies and parallel opportunities
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks have acceptance criteria; Phase 5 includes full validation suite (colcon test)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (specs/002-ros2-mastery/tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to begin Phase 1 execution (T001-T008)
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown successfully maps user requirements (5 phases, 22 tasks) to executable implementation plan. All tasks follow strict checklist format with task IDs, parallelizable markers, and file paths.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - tasks generation successful
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation: PASS (all 22 tasks follow `- [ ] T### [P] Description with file path` format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with explicit phase structure from user
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks (T001-T008) using relevant agents/skills
