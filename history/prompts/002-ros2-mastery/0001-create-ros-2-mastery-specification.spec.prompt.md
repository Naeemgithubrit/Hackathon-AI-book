## Prompt

```text
Module 01 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Target audience: Learners who know Python but have zero ROS 2 experience
Focus: Master ROS 2 as the universal middleware for all modern robots

Success criteria:
- Reader can create, build, and debug a multi-node ROS 2 workspace from scratch in <20 minutes
- Reader can model and visualize any humanoid robot using URDF/Xacro in RViz
- All provided code examples pass `colcon test` with zero errors/warnings

Constraints:
- 70–90 pages total
- Minimum 8 complete, progressively complex hands-on projects
- All examples must run on clean Ubuntu 22.04 with ≤3 non-standard apt dependencies

Not building:
- ROS 1 migration guides
- C++ examples (Python/rclpy only)
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for "Module 01 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" covering 4 prioritized user stories and 12 functional requirements.

**Specification Structure:**
- **4 User Stories**: (P1) ROS 2 Workspace Creation & Multi-Node Development, (P1) Robot Modeling with URDF/Xacro & Visualization, (P1) Progressive Hands-On Projects for Skill Building, (P2) Automated Testing & Code Quality Validation
- **12 Functional Requirements**: Covering ROS 2 core concepts explanation, workspace creation instructions, 8 progressive projects, URDF/Xacro teaching, RViz demonstration, debugging techniques, Python/rclpy-only constraint, automated testing requirement, dependency limits, test suites, ROS 1 exclusion, and template provision
- **8 Success Criteria**: All measurable and learner-facing, including workspace creation time (20 minutes), URDF modeling success rate (85%), test pass rate (100%), project completion time (16 hours), page length (70-90 pages), dependency limits (≤3), debugging proficiency (80%), and project completeness
- **Key Entities**: ROS 2 Workspace, ROS 2 Package, Node, URDF/Xacro Model, Project Template
- **4 Edge Cases**: Environment conflicts, URDF syntax errors, dependency issues, silent node failures

**Quality Validation:**
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements clear and actionable
- All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- Specification maintains proper abstraction (WHAT/WHY, not HOW)
- Ready for `/sp.plan` phase

**Key Decisions:**
- Prioritized three core capabilities as P1: Workspace Creation, URDF/Xacro Modeling, and Progressive Projects (all foundational for robotics development)
- Required minimum 8 hands-on projects (FR-003) to ensure progressive skill building
- Mandated 100% test pass rate (SC-003, FR-008) via colcon test for all code examples
- Scoped to Python/rclpy only, excluding C++ per user constraints (FR-007, Out of Scope)
- Set strict dependency limit (≤3 non-standard apt packages) for reproducibility (FR-009, SC-006)
- Excluded ROS 1 content entirely to maintain focus on modern ROS 2 practices (FR-011)
- Targeted 70-90 page length to provide comprehensive coverage without overwhelming learners
- Assumed Chapter 1 completion (development environment must be working)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready specification for Module 01 (ROS 2) with 4 user stories, 12 functional requirements, and 8 measurable success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist PASSED - all criteria met, zero clarifications needed
- 📁 Files: specs/002-ros2-mastery/spec.md (specification), specs/002-ros2-mastery/checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan for Module 01 content development, including design of 8 progressive projects
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances hands-on learning with quality validation. The 8-project minimum (FR-003) with automated testing (FR-010) ensures practical skill acquisition while maintaining educational rigor. Python-only constraint (FR-007) reduces cognitive load for learners transitioning from Python backgrounds.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Specification passed all quality checks on first validation iteration.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Content Quality (4/4), PASS - Requirement Completeness (8/8), PASS - Feature Readiness (4/4)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify execution with module-level scope (Module 01 only, focused on ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether 70-90 page constraint is sufficient for 8 progressive projects plus ROS 2 core concepts and URDF/Xacro teaching. May need adjustment if each project requires extensive explanation (average 8-10 pages per project plus foundational content).
