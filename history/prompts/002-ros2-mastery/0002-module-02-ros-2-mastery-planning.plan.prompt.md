## Prompt

```text
Module 02 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Create:
- Full Docusaurus sub-sidebar + 12–15 pages outline (fundamentals → URDF → TF2 → actions → launch files)
- 8 progressive hands-on labs (from talker/listener → full humanoid URDF in RViz)
- Complete colcon workspace template repository structure
- Exact ROS 2 version decision (Humble vs. Jazzy) with trade-off table
- Mermaid sequence diagrams for action server/client and navigation stack
- Minimum 40 citations (ROS 2 papers, official docs, ICRA/IROS tutorials)
Testing strategy:
  - All 8 labs must `colcon build && colcon test` with zero warnings on Ubuntu 22.04
  - Final humanoid URDF must load in RViz with working joint states and TF tree
Deliver as specs/002-ros2-mastery/plan.md + separate capstone-style repo skeleton for ROS 2 examples
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 02 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) with the following structure:

**Plan Document** (specs/002-ros2-mastery/plan.md):
- **Summary**: 12-15 Docusaurus pages + 8 progressive labs (talker/listener → full humanoid URDF in RViz)
- **Technical Context**: ROS 2 Humble (LTS May 2027), Python 3.10.12, C++17, exact dependency versions specified
- **Constitution Check**: ✅ All 7 principles pass (Educational Clarity, Engineering Accuracy, Practical Applicability, Spec-Driven Development, Ethical Responsibility, Reproducibility, Zero Broken State)
- **Project Structure**:
  - Documentation: 16 Docusaurus pages in `docs/module-02-ros2-mastery/`
  - Capstone Repository: Separate `ros2-humanoid-labs` GitHub repo with 8 lab packages
- **Phase 0 Research Plan**: 5 research tasks (R1-R5) to resolve unknowns:
  - R1: Humble vs. Jazzy decision matrix
  - R2: Exact dependency versions (colcon, ament, rclpy, rclcpp, testing frameworks)
  - R3: Citation collection (40+ references from ICRA/IROS, IEEE, ROS Discourse)
  - R4: URDF/TF2 best practices (REP 120, humanoid conventions)
  - R5: colcon workspace best practices
- **Phase 1 Design**: Data model entities (RobotState msg, SetJointAngle srv, MoveArm action, HumanoidURDF), API contracts (YAML schemas), quickstart guide

**Key Decisions**:
1. **ROS 2 Humble** selected (LTS until May 2027, Isaac Sim 2024.1.1 compatible)
2. **Separate capstone repository** (`ros2-humanoid-labs`) for hands-on labs
3. **5-DOF humanoid model**: torso + 2 arms (shoulder pitch, elbow, wrist roll per arm)
4. **Testing requirement**: `colcon build && colcon test` with zero warnings
5. **8 progressive labs**: pub/sub → custom msgs → services → actions → URDF → TF2 → launch → RViz

**Constraints**:
- Zero build warnings (`COLCON_LOG_LEVEL=warn`)
- Valid TF tree (`ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames` must succeed)
- Copy-paste functional code (no "..." placeholders)
- Max 3 external dependencies per lab package

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive plan created with detailed lab structure, capstone repo architecture, and research roadmap
- 🧪 Tests: No tests yet (planning phase)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (specs/002-ros2-mastery/plan.md), 1 directory created (specs/002-ros2-mastery/contracts/)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase 0 research execution (R1-R5), then data model design, then `/sp.tasks` breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan successfully defines all requirements for Module 02. Research phase will resolve Humble vs. Jazzy decision and lock dependency versions for reproducibility.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - plan creation successful
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check: PASS (all 7 principles validated)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 0 research tasks to generate research.md
