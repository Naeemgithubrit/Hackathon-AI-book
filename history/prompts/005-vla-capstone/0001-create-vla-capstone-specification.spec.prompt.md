## Prompt

```text
Module 04 — Vision-Language-Action & The Autonomous Humanoid (Capstone)

Target audience: Students who completed Modules 1–3
Focus: Close the loop — natural language → planning → physical execution

Success criteria:
- Single public GitHub repository that runs end-to-end:
  'Bring me the red cup from the kitchen' → (voice → LLM → path → navigation → grasp → return)
- Works in unseen apartment scenes in Isaac Sim with ≥80 % success
- Optional Jetson deployment instructions included and tested
- Entire original codebase <2000 lines

Constraints:
- 90–120 pages
- <2000 lines of original code
- Open-source / free-tier models only (Whisper, LLaVA, GPT-4o free API)
- Full architecture diagram required

Deliverable:
- Single public GitHub repository with complete capstone
- Optional Jetson deployment instructions

Not building:
- Real humanoid hardware (Isaac Sim only; Jetson deployment as optional bonus)
- Custom VLM/LLM training from scratch
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for "Module 04 — Vision-Language-Action & The Autonomous Humanoid (Capstone)" with 4 P1 user stories and 13 functional requirements covering complete end-to-end autonomous humanoid system integrating voice, vision-language models, LLM planning, and robotic skills.

**Specification Structure:**
- **4 User Stories**: (P1) Voice-to-Action Pipeline Integration (natural language commands → execution), (P1) Vision-Language Model Integration (scene understanding, object localization), (P1) Autonomous Navigation and Manipulation Skills (6-skill library), (P1) Complete Capstone Project Deployment (GitHub repository, architecture diagram, Docker setup)
- **13 Functional Requirements**: VLA architecture, Whisper voice integration, LLM task planning (GPT-4o/LLaVA/Llama 3), VLM scene understanding, 6-skill library (navigate, locate, approach, grasp, place, release), end-to-end demo integration, <2000 line code budget, architecture diagram, GitHub repository template, error handling/replanning, optional Jetson deployment, open-source/free-tier models only, evaluation methodology
- **10 Success Criteria**: 80% achieve ≥80% task success rate on 10-command benchmark, 90% voice integration (≥95% accuracy), 85% VLM integration (≥90% object ID, ≤10cm error), 100% <2000 line code compliance, 100% architecture diagrams, 75% end-to-end demo completion, 90-120 pages, 70% error handling implementation, 50% optional Jetson deployment, 100% ≤30 min setup reproducibility
- **Key Entities**: VLA Pipeline, LLM Task Planner, Vision-Language Model (VLM), Skill Library, Capstone Repository
- **5 Edge Cases**: Voice recognition failures, LLM hallucinations/impossible plans, object not found, VLM failures, grasp failures with retry logic

**Quality Validation:**
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All success criteria measurable with specific metrics (80% task success, 95% voice accuracy, 90% VLM accuracy, <2000 lines code, ≤30 min setup)
- Specification maintains proper abstraction (WHAT/WHY, not HOW)
- Ready for `/sp.plan` phase

**Key Decisions:**
- All 4 user stories prioritized as P1 (Voice Pipeline, VLM Integration, Skills Library, Capstone Deployment) - each essential for complete autonomous system
- Strict code budget: <2000 lines original application code (FR-007, SC-004) to enforce clean architecture and reusable components
- Performance targets: ≥80% task success rate on varied commands (SC-001), ≥95% voice transcription accuracy (SC-002), ≥90% object identification accuracy with ≤10cm localization error (SC-003), ≤30 min setup time (SC-010)
- Open-source/free-tier models only (FR-012): Whisper for voice, GPT-4o API free tier or LLaVA/Llama 3 for planning, LLaVA for VLM scene understanding
- Required 6-skill minimum library (FR-005): navigate_to, locate_object, approach_object, grasp_object, place_object, release_object - composable by LLM planner
- Mandatory architecture diagram (FR-008, SC-005) showing all major components and data flow for system-level understanding
- Error handling and replanning strategies (FR-010, SC-008) for real-world robustness: retry, replan, user notification
- Optional Jetson deployment (FR-011, SC-009) provides edge experience without mandatory hardware requirement: workstation for VLM inference, Jetson for navigation/manipulation
- Repository template with Docker setup (FR-009) ensures reproducibility on RTX 4070 Ti+ systems
- Benchmark evaluation methodology (FR-013) with 10 varied commands in unseen Isaac Sim apartment scenes
- Assumed Modules 01-03 completion for ROS 2, simulation, Isaac Platform foundation
- 90-120 page length for comprehensive capstone coverage (longer than other modules due to integration complexity)
- Single public GitHub repository deliverable (FR-007) as portfolio-ready capstone demonstration

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Production-ready specification for Module 04 (VLA Capstone) with 4 user stories, 13 functional requirements, 10 measurable success criteria integrating entire learning path into autonomous humanoid system
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist PASSED - all criteria met, zero clarifications
- 📁 Files: specs/005-vla-capstone/spec.md, specs/005-vla-capstone/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan including VLA pipeline architecture, skill library design, model integration strategy, error handling framework, and evaluation harness
- 🧠 Reflection: Capstone specification successfully synthesizes all previous modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, Isaac Platform) into end-to-end autonomous system. Code budget (<2000 lines) encourages clean architecture. Performance targets (≥80% task success, ≥95% voice, ≥90% VLM accuracy) are challenging but achievable with proper integration. Optional Jetson deployment balances edge experience with accessibility. Architecture diagram requirement ensures system-level thinking beyond code implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Passed all quality checks on first iteration.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Content Quality (4/4), PASS - Requirement Completeness (8/8), PASS - Feature Readiness (4/4)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify execution for Module 04 (Capstone)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether 90-120 pages accommodates complete VLA pipeline coverage (voice integration, LLM planning, VLM scene understanding, 6-skill library, error handling, Docker setup, evaluation methodology, optional Jetson deployment). Capstone complexity may benefit from upper bound of page range (120 pages). Consider if skill library implementation guidance (grasping, manipulation primitives) needs dedicated sub-sections or can reference Module 03 Isaac ROS manipulation nodes.
