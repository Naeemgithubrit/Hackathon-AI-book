response_text: |
  Successfully implemented the ChatKit integration for the RAG chatbot following the specifications from chatkit-knowledge.md:

  1. Created MemoryStore implementation with all 14 required methods as specified in the knowledge base
  2. Created RAGChatKitServer that integrates with the existing RAG agent and implements the ID collision fix for Gemini
  3. Updated main.py to include the /chatkit endpoint that processes ChatKit requests
  4. Created CustomChatWidgetWidget.tsx frontend component following the knowledge base specifications (CDN script, domainKey, thread persistence, etc.)
  5. Created Layout wrapper to inject the chat widget on all pages
  6. Updated pyproject.toml to properly configure package discovery
  7. All components successfully tested and integrated

  Key features implemented:
  - Proper ChatKit store interface with all required methods
  - ID collision fix for non-OpenAI providers (like Gemini)
  - Conversation history for agent memory
  - Thread persistence using localStorage
  - Text highlighting functionality
  - Proper error handling
outcome: "Successfully implemented full ChatKit integration with RAG backend"
evaluation: "All components work together correctly, imports are successful, and the implementation follows the knowledge base specifications"
