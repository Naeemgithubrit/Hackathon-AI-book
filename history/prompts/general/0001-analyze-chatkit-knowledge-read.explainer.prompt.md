  just read .claude/chatkit-specialist/chatkit-knowledge.md and do let me know are you comfortable of applying this in my current project
response_text: |
  I've analyzed the ChatKit knowledge base and your current project. Your project already has:
  - FastAPI backend with RAG functionality
  - OpenAI ChatKit and Agents SDK dependencies
  - Some existing ChatKit endpoints
  - Gemini integration with OpenAI-compatible API

  I am comfortable applying this ChatKit knowledge to your project because:
  1. You have compatible architecture with correct dependencies
  2. You've already started ChatKit integration
  3. Your components can be integrated with ChatKit's store system

  Critical issues to address:
  1. ID collision fix needed for Gemini (non-OpenAI provider)
  2. Full Store interface implementation required
  3. Conversation memory setup for agent memory
outcome: "Successfully analyzed ChatKit knowledge base and confirmed compatibility with current project"
evaluation: "The analysis confirmed that the ChatKit knowledge can be applied to the existing RAG chatbot project with proper modifications"

## Analysis of ChatKit Knowledge Base for Current Project

### Current Project State:
- RAG-based chatbot with FastAPI backend
- Cohere embeddings + Qdrant vector database
- OpenAI Agents SDK with Gemini integration
- Session management system
- Existing basic ChatKit endpoints

### Compatibility Assessment:
- ✅ Dependencies match: openai-chatkit>=1.4.0 and openai-agents>=0.6.2
- ✅ Architecture is compatible with ChatKit integration
- ✅ Foundation already laid with basic ChatKit endpoints

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **ID Collision Fix Required**: For Gemini (non-OpenAI provider) to prevent message overwrites
2. **Store Implementation**: Need full 14-method Store interface for persistence
3. **Conversation Memory**: Need ThreadItemConverter for proper agent memory

### Recommendation:
Proceed with ChatKit integration using the knowledge base guidance, implementing the ID mapping fix and full Store interface.
