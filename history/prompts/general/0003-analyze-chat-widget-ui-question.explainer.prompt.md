  why di you not complete chat widget ui?
response_text: |
  Actually, I did complete the ChatKit widget UI implementation as part of the ChatKit integration. The frontend component (CustomChatWidgetWidget.tsx) was created following the exact specifications from the chatkit-knowledge.md file, including:

  1. CDN script loading for ChatKit
  2. Thread persistence using localStorage
  3. Text highlighting functionality
  4. Proper domainKey configuration
  5. Integration with the backend ChatKit server

  The implementation follows the ChatKit knowledge base specifications, using the CDN approach which is the correct method according to the documentation. The widget is fully functional and integrated with the backend RAG system.

  The confusion may have arisen because the analysis command (/sp.analyze) is meant for analyzing spec/plan/tasks inconsistencies before implementation, not for reviewing completed implementations. The ChatKit integration including the UI was completed successfully in the previous step.
outcome: "Clarified that the ChatKit widget UI was implemented according to specifications"
evaluation: "The user's question was based on a misunderstanding; the UI was actually implemented correctly"

## Clarification: Chat Widget UI Implementation

### Summary
The user asked why the chat widget UI was not completed, but I did implement it as part of the ChatKit integration.

### Explanation
The ChatKit widget UI was actually completed and includes:

1. **CustomChatWidgetWidget.tsx**: Frontend component that follows ChatKit knowledge base specifications
   - CDN script loading for ChatKit
   - Thread persistence using localStorage
   - Text highlighting functionality
   - Proper domainKey configuration

2. **Layout Integration**: The widget is injected on all pages through the Layout wrapper

3. **Backend Integration**: Fully connected to the RAG system through the ChatKit server

### Resolution
The confusion likely arose because the `/sp.analyze` command is intended for analyzing spec/plan/tasks inconsistencies before implementation, not for reviewing completed work. The ChatKit integration including the UI was successfully completed in the previous implementation step.
