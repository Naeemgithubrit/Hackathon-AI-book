## Prompt

```text
Module 03 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform)

Target audience: Learners ready for 2025 state-of-the-art perception and sim-to-real
Focus: Replace traditional robotics stacks with NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated pipeline

Success criteria:
- Reader can run full Isaac Sim + ROS 2 bridge with a humanoid at 60+ FPS
- Reader can deploy Isaac ROS VSLAM + Nav2 on Jetson Orin with live RealSense camera
- Reader can generate 10 000 labeled synthetic images in <30 minutes

Constraints:
- 80–100 pages
- All Isaac ROS examples must run on Jetson Orin Nano/Orin NX
- Must include exact Dockerfiles for workstation and Jetson

Not building:
- Training of foundation models from scratch
- Non-NVIDIA alternatives (e.g., Intel ISAAC, Habitat)
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for "Module 03 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™ Platform)" with 4 user stories and 12 functional requirements covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Jetson deployment, and synthetic data generation.

**Specification Structure:**
- **4 User Stories**: (P1) High-Performance Isaac Sim + ROS 2 Integration (≥60 FPS), (P1) Jetson Orin Deployment with Isaac ROS (VSLAM + Nav2), (P1) Synthetic Data Generation (10K images in <30 min), (P2) Dockerized Workflow
- **12 Functional Requirements**: Isaac platform architecture, 60+ FPS Isaac Sim performance, GPU-accelerated perception (Isaac ROS), Jetson Orin deployment, Nav2 integration, synthetic data generation, exact Dockerfiles, Jetson Nano/NX validation, sim-to-real guidance, foundation model exclusion, NVIDIA-only focus, performance benchmarking
- **8 Success Criteria**: 90% achieve 60+ FPS, 85% successful Jetson deployment, 100% data generation accuracy (<30 min), 100% Docker image compatibility, 80% complete sim-to-real pipeline, 80-100 pages, real-time Jetson performance, 75% troubleshooting proficiency
- **Key Entities**: Isaac Sim Environment, Isaac ROS Pipeline, Jetson Deployment Configuration, Synthetic Dataset, Docker Container Specification

**Quality Validation:**
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All success criteria measurable with specific metrics
- Specification maintains proper abstraction (WHAT/WHY, not HOW)
- Ready for `/sp.plan` phase

**Key Decisions:**
- Triple P1 priorities: Isaac Sim Performance, Jetson Deployment, and Synthetic Data (all essential for GPU-accelerated robotics)
- Strict performance targets: ≥60 FPS Isaac Sim, 10K images in <30 min, real-time Jetson perception (≥10Hz VSLAM, ≥30Hz obstacles)
- Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) as minimum hardware for accessibility while maintaining GPU benefits
- Required exact Dockerfiles for both workstation and Jetson to ensure reproducibility
- Excluded foundation model training (fine-tuning/inference only) per user constraints
- NVIDIA-exclusive focus (no Intel ISAAC, Habitat, or alternatives)
- Assumed Modules 01-02 completion for ROS 2 and simulation fundamentals
- 80-100 page length for comprehensive coverage of entire NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Production-ready specification for Module 03 (NVIDIA Isaac Platform) with 4 user stories, 12 functional requirements, 8 measurable success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist PASSED - all criteria met, zero clarifications
- 📁 Files: specs/004-isaac-platform/spec.md, specs/004-isaac-platform/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan including Isaac Sim setup, Jetson provisioning strategy, Docker image architecture, and synthetic data pipeline design
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification balances cutting-edge GPU acceleration with accessibility (Jetson Nano minimum). Performance targets (60+ FPS, <30 min for 10K images) are aggressive but achievable on specified hardware. Docker requirement ensures reproducibility across complex NVIDIA software stack.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Passed all quality checks on first iteration.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Content Quality (4/4), PASS - Requirement Completeness (8/8), PASS - Feature Readiness (4/4)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify execution for Module 03
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if 80-100 pages sufficient for Isaac Sim (simulation), Isaac ROS (perception), Jetson deployment, synthetic data generation, and Docker workflows. Dense technical content may require upper bound of page range.
