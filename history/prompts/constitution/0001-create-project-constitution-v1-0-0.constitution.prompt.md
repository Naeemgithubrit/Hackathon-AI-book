## Prompt

```text
Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book — Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and Agentic Engineering
Platform: Docusaurus documentation site deployed to GitHub Pages
Tooling: Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code

Core principles:
- Educational clarity for learners transitioning from beginner to advanced
- Engineering accuracy: robotics, AI, cloud-native, and agentic design principles must be authentic and up-to-date
- Practical applicability: every concept must translate into hands-on implementation
- Ethical responsibility: safety, responsible AI usage, and physical interaction guidelines must be emphasized
- Open knowledge: documentation, code examples, and architecture must be reproducible and community-contributable

Key standards:
- Content must be original and derived from authoritative technical sources, documentation, or peer-reviewed research
- Code examples should be executable, version-accurate, and run locally
- Topics related to robotics must follow industry-validated frameworks (ROS2, URDF, control systems, etc.)
- AI topics must reflect modern engineering practice (LLMs, embeddings, autonomy, agent orchestration)
- All architectural diagrams should be described textually (Spec-Driven) and optionally rendered
- Citation style: inline reference (standard academic or official docs link)
- Documentation tone: mentor-to-student, respectful, high clarity

Book structure standards:
- Every chapter driven by an approved .spec file (Spec-Kit Plus)
- Progressive difficulty: fundamentals → intermediate → advanced projects
- End-of-chapter exercises or mini-projects with full solutions in a separate branch
- Glossary and cross-references automatically generated
- Zero broken links on deployed GitHub Pages site

Constraints:
- Repository must build and deploy successfully on every push to main
- Images/diagrams: original or CC-BY/CC0 licensed with attribution
- Maximum 5 external dependencies per hands-on example (prefer pure Python/ROS2)

Success criteria:
- 100 % of chapters have merged, versioned .spec files
- All code examples pass automated tests (GitHub Actions)
- Deployed site has zero dead links and zero console errors
- At least one real humanoid-relevant or agentic project fully reproducible by readers
- Passes review by at least two domain experts (robotics + AI/agent engineering) before v1.0 release
```

## Response snapshot

Created the project constitution v1.0.0 for the AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and Agentic Engineering.

**Constitution Structure:**
- **7 Core Principles**: Educational Clarity, Engineering Accuracy, Practical Applicability (non-negotiable), Spec-Driven Development, Ethical Responsibility, Reproducibility & Open Knowledge, Zero Broken State
- **Content Standards**: Originality & Attribution, Code Quality, Technical Frameworks, Tone & Structure
- **Development & Deployment Workflow**: Chapter Development (8-step process), Deployment (automated via GitHub Actions), Testing, Community Contributions
- **Governance**: Amendment Process (with semantic versioning), Compliance requirements, Documentation precedence, Release Criteria for v1.0

**Key Decisions:**
- Established Spec-Driven Development as a core principle (Principle IV)
- Made Practical Applicability non-negotiable (Principle III)
- Emphasized Zero Broken State for continuous validation (Principle VII)
- Set clear v1.0 release criteria including domain expert review requirement
- Defined strict testing requirements: all code examples must pass automated tests
- Established maximum 5 external dependencies per hands-on example
- Required Docusaurus + GitHub Pages platform with automated deployment
- Mandated ROS2/URDF for robotics, modern LLM practices for AI content

**Version:** 1.0.0 (initial ratification)
**Ratification Date:** 2025-12-04

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance for AI/Spec-Driven Book project with 7 core principles, content standards, development workflow, and release criteria
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document; however, constitution establishes testing requirements for all future code examples)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with complete v1.0.0 constitution (zero placeholders remaining)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Consider running /sp.specify to create first chapter spec, or document initial project structure/setup
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully balances educational mission with engineering rigor. The non-negotiable "Practical Applicability" principle and "Zero Broken State" principle will enforce quality. Release criteria requiring two domain expert reviews provides appropriate governance for v1.0.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All placeholders filled, template structure preserved, semantic versioning applied correctly.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Zero unresolved placeholders, PASS - Version follows semver (1.0.0 for initial), PASS - All principles have rationale, PASS - Sync Impact Report included
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.constitution execution with comprehensive user input
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether 5-dependency limit proves sufficient for robotics examples; may need MINOR version bump if ROS2 ecosystems require adjustment
