  Module 03 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

  Target audience: Students who finished Module 01 (ROS 2) and want fast, practical simulation

  Focus: Build realistic, lightweight digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo Harmonic + optional Unity rendering

  Success criteria:
  - Reader can launch a fully sensor-equipped humanoid in Gazebo in <10 minutes
  - Reader can build a complete apartment environment (kitchen + living room + obstacles)
  - Reader can add realistic depth camera, LiDAR, IMU, and contact sensors
  - Reader can optionally connect Unity for beautiful real-time visualization
  - All examples run ≥60 FPS on RTX 4070 Ti with <50 MB assets

  Strict structure — deliver EXACTLY these 4 Markdown files only:
  1. docs/module-02/intro.md                         → short intro + learning goals (max 4 pages)
  2. docs/module-02/01-gazebo-fundamentals.md       → Gazebo Harmonic setup, URDF→SDF, plugins, launch files
  3. docs/module-02/02-sensors-and-humanoid.md      → depth camera, LiDAR, IMU, contact sensors, noise models
  4. docs/module-02/03-apartment-worlds-and-unity.md → building realistic apartment + Unity TCP visualization bridge

  Constraints:
  - Total length: 40–50 formatted pages maximum
  - No extra files, no summary, no appendix
  - All assets CC0 and <50 MB total
  - Use existing reusable skills (urdf-builder, gazebo-world-builder) automatically

  Not building:
  - C++ plugins
  - Full Unity ML-Agents / VR
  - Cloud simulation

  Go.Write this in specs/003-gazebo-simulation/spec.md
