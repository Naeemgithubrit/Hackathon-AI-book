## Prompt

```text
Introduction & Physical AI Foundations

Target audience: Intermediate-to-advanced AI engineers transitioning from digital agents to embodied intelligence
Focus: Why Physical AI and humanoid robotics are the ultimate frontier of applied AI in 2025–2030

Success criteria:
- Reader can clearly articulate why humanoid form factor wins in human environments
- Reader has a fully working development workstation (Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble + Isaac Sim 2024.x/2025 running without crashes)
- Reader understands the minimum viable hardware stack and budget options

Constraints:
- Length: 20–30 formatted pages
- Must include complete 2025 hardware matrix with exact prices and tested configurations
- All installation commands must be copy-paste functional

Not building:
- Beginner Linux/Python tutorials
- History lessons before 2020
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for "Introduction & Physical AI Foundations" (Chapter 1) covering three prioritized user stories and 10 functional requirements.

**Specification Structure:**
- **3 User Stories**: (P1) Understanding Physical AI Value Proposition, (P1) Hardware Setup & Environment Configuration, (P2) Hardware Budget & Configuration Planning
- **10 Functional Requirements**: Covering value proposition content, humanoid form factor justification, installation instructions, hardware specifications, compatibility matrix, verification procedure, prerequisites, scope boundaries, link archiving, and dependency management
- **8 Success Criteria**: All measurable and technology-agnostic, including reader comprehension (90%), setup time (4 hours), command reliability (95%), link archiving (100%), and page length (20-30 pages)
- **Key Entities**: Hardware Configuration, Development Environment, Learning Prerequisites
- **4 Edge Cases**: Mac/Windows alternatives, ARM systems, below-spec hardware, dead external links

**Quality Validation:**
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements clear and actionable
- All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- Specification maintains proper abstraction (WHAT/WHY, not HOW)
- Ready for `/sp.plan` phase

**Key Decisions:**
- Prioritized both "Value Proposition" and "Hardware Setup" as P1 (both blocking for subsequent learning)
- Scoped out beginner tutorials and pre-2020 history content per user constraints
- Required 100% link archiving (Wayback Machine/archive.is) for long-term resource stability
- Specified 20-30 page constraint as SC-007 with Docusaurus page count validation
- Documented Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble + Isaac Sim as the canonical development environment
- Assumed intermediate-to-advanced AI engineering background (post-LLM/agent engineering)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready specification for Chapter 1 with 3 user stories, 10 functional requirements, and 8 measurable success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist PASSED - all criteria met, zero clarifications needed
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-intro/spec.md (specification), specs/001-physical-ai-intro/checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan for Chapter 1 content development
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances educational goals with practical constraints. Hardware specifications intentionally reference specific technologies (Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble, Isaac Sim, RTX GPUs) because these are the subject matter of the educational content, not implementation details of chapter authoring.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Specification passed all quality checks on first validation iteration.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Content Quality (4/4), PASS - Requirement Completeness (8/8), PASS - Feature Readiness (4/4)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify execution with focused chapter scope (Chapter 1 only, not full book)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether 20-30 page constraint proves sufficient for all required content (value proposition + hardware setup + budget planning). May need adjustment based on actual content density during implementation.
