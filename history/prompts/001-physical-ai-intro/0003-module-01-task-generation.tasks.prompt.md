## Prompt

Break Module 01 into 4 phases with atomic tasks (15-45 min each). All output files under /docs/module-00/. Use IEEE citations, archive.is for every link, Docusaurus-ready Markdown. Deliver as 001-physical-ai-intro/task.md.

## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md with 28 implementation tasks across 6 phases organized by user story. 18 tasks parallelizable. 3 user stories (US1: Value Proposition, US2: Hardware Setup, US3: Hardware Budget). Estimated 4-6 hours total. All tasks follow checklist format with IDs, parallelization markers, and file paths.

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation
- Tests: Task format PASS (28/28 tasks), User story mapping PASS, Dependency graph PASS
- Files: tasks.md created
- Next: Begin implementation Phase 1 (Setup) or run /sp.implement
