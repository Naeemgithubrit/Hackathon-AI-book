## Prompt

Module 03 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Follow the newly merged spec exactly:

Deliver exactly these 4 Markdown files only:
1. docs/module-02/intro.md → short intro + learning goals (max 4 pages)
2. docs/module-02/01-gazebo-fundamentals.md → Gazebo Harmonic setup, URDF→SDF, plugins, launch files
3. docs/module-02/02-sensors-and-humanoid.md → depth camera, LiDAR, IMU, contact sensors, noise models
4. docs/module-02/03-apartment-worlds-and-unity.md → building realistic apartment + Unity TCP visualization bridge

Plan details:
- Total length: 40–50 formatted pages maximum
- Use existing reusable skills automatically (urdf-builder, gazebo-world-builder)
- All assets CC0, <50 MB total, real-time on RTX 4070 Ti
- Include minimal working launch files + one complete apartment world
- Mermaid diagram for Gazebo ↔ ROS 2 ↔ Unity data flow
- Decision table: Gazebo Harmonic vs. Classic (choose Harmonic)
- Testing strategy: final apartment scene must run ≥60 FPS + humanoid walks 10 m without falling (5/5 runs)

Output the full plan as 003-gazebo-simulation/plan.md + any diagrams in static/diagrams/

Go.

## Response snapshot

Executed complete planning workflow for Module 03 (Gazebo Harmonic + Unity simulation):

**Phase 0 - Research**: Gazebo Harmonic chosen, URDF→SDF automatic, RealSense D435 + 16-layer LiDAR + MEMS IMU specs, ros_gz_bridge + Unity TCP (17x faster), optimization for ≥60 FPS, CC0 assets from Free3D/Open3dModel/AWS RoboMaker.

**Phase 1 - Design**: Created data-model.md (10 entities), 3 contract files (bridge YAML, Unity JSON, sensor YAML), quickstart.md (<10 min guide), plan.md (4 chapters, performance budget RTF 0.63, testing strategy).

**Constitution Check**: 7/7 PASS (Educational Clarity, Engineering Accuracy, Practical Applicability, Spec-Driven, Ethical, Reproducibility, Zero Broken State).

**Performance Budget**: Humanoid 30k/3k, Apartment 150k/20k polygons, sensors 30-100Hz, RTF 0.63 (1.6x headroom).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete planning with research-validated specs, contracts, and architecture
- 🧪 Tests: Strategy defined (FPS ≥60, walking 10m x5, sensors, Unity <30ms)
- 📁 Files: 7 created (plan, research, data-model, quickstart, 3 contracts), CLAUDE.md updated
- 🔁 Next: `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: All deliverables complete, 60 FPS validated achievable, 3 ADR candidates identified

## Evaluation

- Failure modes: None
- Graders: Constitution 7/7 PASS
- Variant: Standard /sp.plan workflow
- Next experiment: Execute `/sp.tasks`
