## Prompt

```text
Module 02 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Target audience: Students comfortable with ROS 2 who need physics-accurate simulation
Focus: Build believable digital worlds and simulate realistic sensors

Success criteria:
- Reader can spawn a humanoid in Gazebo that walks, pushes objects, and publishes realistic depth + LiDAR data
- Reader can create a multi-room apartment environment from scratch
- Simulation runs at real-time or faster on RTX 4070 Ti+

Constraints:
- 60–75 pages
- Must include ready-to-use apartment assets (CC0 or original)
- Unity section limited to visualization/HRI only (no Unity ML-Agents)

Not building:
- Custom physics engines
- Advanced Gazebo plugins in C++
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for "Module 02 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" covering 4 prioritized user stories and 12 functional requirements.

**Specification Structure:**
- **4 User Stories**: (P1) Humanoid Robot Simulation with Physics & Sensors, (P1) Environment Creation & Scene Design, (P2) Unity Visualization & HRI, (P2) Real-Time Performance Optimization
- **12 Functional Requirements**: Covering Gazebo architecture, humanoid spawning, environment creation, CC0 apartment assets, sensor simulation, physical interactions, Unity integration, Unity scope limits, performance optimization, troubleshooting guidance, plugin constraints, and hardware validation
- **8 Success Criteria**: All measurable and learner-focused, including humanoid walking/pushing success rate (85%), apartment creation time (2 hours), sensor data accuracy (100%), real-time performance (≥1.0x), Unity setup success (80%), page length (60-75), asset licensing compliance (100%), and performance optimization capability (75% improve by ≥50%)
- **Key Entities**: Simulation Environment, Simulated Robot, Sensor Model, Asset Library, Unity Visualization Scene
- **4 Edge Cases**: Physics slowdown, sensor data mismatches, Unity-Gazebo sync failures, custom asset creation

**Quality Validation:**
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements clear and actionable
- All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- Specification maintains proper abstraction (WHAT/WHY, not HOW)
- Ready for `/sp.plan` phase

**Key Decisions:**
- Prioritized both Physics Simulation and Environment Creation as P1 (both essential for meaningful robot testing)
- Required CC0 or original apartment assets (FR-004, SC-007) for legal compliance and reproducibility
- Mandated real-time performance (≥1.0x real-time factor) on RTX 4070 Ti minimum (FR-009, FR-012, SC-004) as critical quality gate
- Limited Unity to visualization/HRI only, excluding ML-Agents per user constraints (FR-008)
- Excluded custom physics engines and advanced C++ plugins to maintain accessibility (FR-011, Out of Scope)
- Assumed Module 01 (ROS 2 Mastery) completion as prerequisite for URDF/Xacro and ROS 2 skills
- Targeted Gazebo Harmonic (not Gazebo Classic) as modern simulation platform
- Set 60-75 page length for comprehensive coverage of both Gazebo and Unity

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready specification for Module 02 (Gazebo & Unity simulation) with 4 user stories, 12 functional requirements, and 8 measurable success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist PASSED - all criteria met, zero clarifications needed
- 📁 Files: specs/003-gazebo-simulation/spec.md (specification), specs/003-gazebo-simulation/checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan for Module 02, including design of apartment asset library and performance benchmarking strategy
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances physics accuracy with performance constraints. Real-time requirement (≥1.0x on RTX 4070 Ti) is critical for learner success and will need careful validation. CC0 asset requirement ensures legal compliance while Unity-for-visualization-only constraint prevents scope creep into ML training.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Specification passed all quality checks on first validation iteration.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Content Quality (4/4), PASS - Requirement Completeness (8/8), PASS - Feature Readiness (4/4)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify execution with module-level scope (Module 02 covering both Gazebo and Unity)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether 60-75 page constraint accommodates both Gazebo (physics simulation, environment creation, sensors) and Unity (visualization, HRI, bridge setup) adequately. May need to adjust page allocation or depth of Unity coverage based on content density during implementation.
