## Prompt

/sp.clarify

(No additional arguments provided - standard clarification workflow on active feature spec)

## Response snapshot

Conducted structured ambiguity scan on RAG chatbot specification and resolved 3 high-impact clarifications through interactive questioning:

**Question 1 - Off-Topic Question Handling**:
- Context: Edge case identified but response strategy undefined
- Answer: Polite refusal with suggested topics from the documentation (Option B)
- Integration: Added FR-019, updated Edge Cases section

**Question 2 - Documentation Chunking Strategy**:
- Context: FR-017 mentioned "semantically meaningful segments" but lacked concrete size limit
- Answer: 384 tokens per chunk (medium granularity, Option B)
- Integration: Enhanced FR-017 with specific token limit, updated Documentation Chunk entity definition

**Question 3 - API Rate Limit Error Handling**:
- Context: Edge case mentioned Gemini API rate limits but recovery strategy not defined
- Answer: Queue request with exponential backoff retry + show "Processing..." message to user (Option B)
- Integration: Added FR-015a with detailed rate limit handling behavior, updated Edge Cases section

**Coverage Analysis Results**:
- 10 categories Clear (no changes needed)
- 3 categories Resolved (clarifications applied)
- 2 categories Deferred to Planning (observability, deployment configuration)

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/sp.plan` - all critical ambiguities resolved, specification ready for architectural design.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Eliminated 3 high-impact specification ambiguities that would have caused implementation uncertainty
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (specification clarification phase)
- 📁 Files: specs/rag-chatbot/spec.md (updated with Clarifications section + 3 Q&A pairs, FR-015a, FR-019, enhanced FR-017)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` (proceed with architectural design)
- 🧠 Reflection: Interactive clarification workflow successfully identified and resolved edge case handling gaps. User selected Option B for all three questions, showing preference for balanced approaches (medium granularity chunking, helpful error messages, graceful degradation). Deferred observability and deployment details appropriately to planning phase where implementation patterns are chosen.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - workflow executed cleanly
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Coverage scan taxonomy applied (10 Clear, 3 Resolved, 2 Deferred) - all critical categories now resolved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.clarify workflow with 3-question limit (under 5 max)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding "confidence score" to clarification questions to help users prioritize which questions have highest implementation impact
