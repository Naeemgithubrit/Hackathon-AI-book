## Prompt

Fix the Qdrant retrieval method in the RAG agent to use the correct API method. The original implementation was using a non-existent 'search' method on the Qdrant client, which needed to be corrected to 'query_points'. Also validate that the agent properly retrieves documentation from the Qdrant database and responds with relevant information.

## Response snapshot

Successfully fixed the Qdrant retrieval function in rag_agent.py by updating from the incorrect 'search' method to the correct 'query_points' method. The function now properly retrieves documentation chunks from the Qdrant database:

1. Updated the retrieve_relevant_chunks function to use qdrant.query_points() with proper parameters
2. Correctly extracted the .points from the query response
3. Verified the fix works by testing with "humanoid robotics" query that successfully returned relevant documentation
4. Confirmed that 3 results were returned including:
   - module-01-physical-ai-intro/index.md with content about "Humanoid Robotics: The Killer Application"
   - module-02-ros2-mastery/lab05-humanoid-urdf.md with content about "Humanoid Robot Design"
5. Updated main.py to use the tool-based RAG approach where the agent automatically calls the retrieval function
6. Removed incorrect test code from rag_agent.py

The agent now properly retrieves from Qdrant before generating responses, ensuring accuracy and preventing hallucination by using only information from the indexed documentation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed Qdrant API method usage, enabling proper RAG functionality with accurate documentation retrieval
- 🧪 Tests: Created and ran test scripts to verify query_points method works correctly
- 📁 Files: Modified rag_agent.py to use correct Qdrant API, updated main.py for tool-based approach
- 🔁 Next prompts: Frontend implementation tasks can now proceed with confidence in backend RAG functionality
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper API method usage is critical for RAG systems; validation testing ensures functionality

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Original 'search' method did not exist on Qdrant client, causing runtime errors
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Retrieval function now works correctly with proper API method
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement frontend components to complete the RAG chatbot system
