## Prompt

RAG Chatbot for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Follow the just-approved spec in specs/rag-chatbot/spec.md exactly.

Create the full execution plan including:

1. Architecture diagram (Mermaid) — ChatKit JS ↔ FastAPI ↔ OpenAI Agents SDK ↔ Qdrant + auto-reindex flow
2. Detailed folder/file structure (frontend widget + backend/ changes)
3. Step-by-step integration plan
4. Decision table: Render vs Railway deployment (choose Render)
5. Testing strategy with exact commands
6. Risk mitigation

Note : Output diagrams in specs/static/diagrams/

Go.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan with 7 planning artifacts:

**Phase 0 - Research**: Investigated OpenAI Agents SDK, ChatKit JS, Docusaurus via Context7 MCP. Documented 11 technology decisions (streaming patterns, text highlighting, deployment platform selection). Resolved all Technical Context unknowns.

**Phase 1 - Design**: Created data-model.md (4 entities with ERD), API contracts (chat-api.yaml, reindex-api.yaml), architecture diagrams (10 Mermaid diagrams), quickstart.md (local setup + deployment), and plan.md (implementation phases).

**Key Decisions**: Render deployment (15-30s cold start vs Railway 30-60s), 384-token chunks, in-memory sessions, exponential backoff for rate limits, swizzled Docusaurus Layout.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete architectural design ready for task generation
- 🧪 Tests: 3 exact test scenarios defined (local, deploy, rate-limit)
- 📁 Files: 7 planning docs (plan, research, data-model, quickstart, contracts, diagrams)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks`
- 🧠 Reflection: Context7 MCP integration enabled real code examples for all technologies

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check 7/7 PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan with Context7 MCP research
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add complexity scores to tasks
