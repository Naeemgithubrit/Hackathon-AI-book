## Prompt

User identified missing features from specs/rag-chatbot/spec.md and requested implementation:

1. Text selection from book should show context menu with "Ask from AI" and "Copy" options
2. Clicking "Ask from AI" should open chat widget with selected text pre-populated
3. Chat history should be saved in Neon Postgres database
4. Chat widget should be initially closed (icon only), opening on click

**Critical constraint**: "make sure you dont change current implementations as chatbot is working absolutely fine dont disturb that"

User emphasized:
- Only ADD features to existing working chatbot
- Do NOT rebuild existing routes
- Add database persistence alongside existing functionality
- Create reusable skill package with full code in SKILLS.md file

## Response snapshot

### Phase 3.5: Neon Database Setup (Tasks T105-T110)

**Created Files:**
1. `backend/migrations/001_create_chat_tables.sql` - Database schema with chat_sessions and chat_messages tables
2. `backend/app/database.py` - Connection pool management with asyncpg
3. `backend/app/chat_history.py` - CRUD operations for sessions and messages
4. Updated `backend/main.py` - Added debug endpoints `/api/debug/sessions` and `/api/debug/messages`

**Key Implementation:**
- Used asyncpg connection pool (min=2, max=10 connections)
- Graceful degradation pattern: database errors logged but don't break chatbot
- Thread-to-session mapping via `get_or_create_session_by_thread()` function
- SQL injection protection with parameterized queries
- Transaction support for atomic operations

### Phase 4: Frontend Implementation (Tasks T001-T004)

**Created Files:**
1. `physical-robotics-ai-book/src/components/TextSelectionMenu.tsx` - Context menu for text selection
2. Updated `physical-robotics-ai-book/src/components/ChatKitWidget.tsx` - Collapsible UI
3. Updated `physical-robotics-ai-book/src/theme/Layout/index.tsx` - Integration layer

**Key Features:**
- Text selection shows context menu with "Ask from AI" and "Copy" buttons
- Context menu appears 10px below selected text (centered)
- Only shows for selections longer than 3 characters
- Chat widget starts minimized as floating icon
- Smooth hover effects and animations

### Bug Fixes

**Bug 1: Pre-populated text not appearing**
- Error: "control.setThreadId is not a function"
- Fix: Destructured `setThreadId` and `setComposerValue` directly from `useChatKit()` instead of accessing via `control` object

**Bug 2: Chat history disappears on minimize**
- Problem: Thread ID not persisted across component unmounts
- Fix: Added `onThreadChange` callback to save thread ID to localStorage; added `onReady` callback to restore thread ID

**Bug 3: Slow appearance when opening/closing**
- Problem: ChatKit component was conditionally rendered, causing remount delays
- Fix: Keep ChatKit mounted at all times, toggle visibility with CSS `display` property

**Bug 4: Minimize button overlapping clock icon**
- Fix: Moved minimize button from `right: '10px'` to `left: '10px'`

**Bug 5: Zero sessions and messages in database**
- Problem: Database persistence was added to `/api/chat` endpoint, but ChatKit uses `/chatkit` endpoint
- Fix: Added database persistence to `chatkit_server.py` in `RAGChatKitServer.respond()` method

### Reusable Skill Creation

Created comprehensive `SKILLS.md` file (1941 lines) in `.claude/skills/rag-chatbot-chatkit/` containing:
- Complete code for all 16 files
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- All bug fixes documented and integrated
- Testing procedures
- Customization options
- Troubleshooting section
- Implementation checklist

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented all missing features without breaking existing chatbot functionality. Added database persistence, text selection context menu, and collapsible UI with all bugs fixed.
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing completed for all features: text selection context menu, pre-populated text, chat history persistence, instant minimize/maximize, and database persistence verified via debug endpoints.
- 📁 Files: Created 5 new files (migrations, database.py, chat_history.py, TextSelectionMenu.tsx, SKILLS.md), modified 4 existing files (chatkit_server.py, main.py, ChatKitWidget.tsx, Layout/index.tsx).
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase 5 (Testing and Deployment): Create reindex script, GitHub Actions workflow, test full flow with rate limiting, deploy to Render.
- 🧠 Reflection: Backward compatibility was critical. Used graceful degradation pattern for database operations. Fixed ID collision issue for Gemini by mapping IDs. Thread-to-session mapping required careful consideration of ChatKit's architecture.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: (1) Connection string format error (psql prefix), (2) Unicode emoji encoding in Windows, (3) Incorrect API access pattern for setThreadId/setComposerValue, (4) Thread ID not persisting across remounts, (5) Conditional rendering causing UX delays, (6) Database persistence on wrong endpoint
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual testing PASS for all features. Debug endpoints PASS showing correct session and message counts.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement Phase 5 auto-reindex script and test deployment to production environment with Render.
