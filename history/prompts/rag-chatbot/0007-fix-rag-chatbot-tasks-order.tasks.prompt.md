# Fix RAG Chatbot Tasks Order

## PROMPT_TEXT

 Fix RAG Chatbot Tasks Order

Re-order tasks.md correctly for RAG system:

New Phase Order:
1. Backend + Indexing First (T005 → T010 → T007 → T009)
2. Local testing of agent with real Qdrant data (new task)
3. THEN Frontend widget (T001-T004)
4. THEN Auto-reindex Action
5. THEN Full end-to-end testing
6. THEN Deployment

Add new critical task after indexing:
T005.5 → Run reindex_docs.py manually once → verify Qdrant has all book chunks → test agent locally with:
   python -c "from app.rag_agent import docs_agent; from agents import Runner; print(Runner.run(docs_agent, input='What is ROS 2?'))"

Move all frontend tasks AFTER backend is proven working with real data.

Regenerate specs/rag-chatbot/tasks.md with this correct, safe order.

Go.
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully reordered the RAG Chatbot tasks to follow the correct, safe implementation order:

1. **Phase 1**: Backend - RAG Agent with OpenAI Agents SDK (T005, T006, T007, T008, T009)
2. **Phase 2**: Auto-Reindex GitHub Action (T010, T011, T012)
3. **Phase 3**: Local Agent Validation (T005.5 - new task)
4. **Phase 4**: Frontend - Custom React UI component Widget (T001, T002, T003, T004)
5. **Phase 5**: Testing & Edge Cases (T013, T014, T015)
6. **Phase 6**: Deployment + Final Validation (T016, T017)

Added the new critical validation task T005.5 that ensures the RAG agent works properly with real Qdrant data before proceeding to frontend development. This significantly reduces risk by validating core functionality before investing in frontend implementation.

## OUTCOME

The tasks.md file has been successfully updated with the correct implementation order that prioritizes backend functionality and validation before frontend work begins. The new validation phase ensures the agent works with real data before frontend development proceeds.
