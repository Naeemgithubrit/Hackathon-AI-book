# Fix RAG Chatbot Implementation Order

## PROMPT_TEXT

```
Fix RAG Chatbot Implementation Order

Update the current plan.md with correct execution order:

New Phase Order:
1. Backend RAG Agent + Qdrant Indexing First
2. Manual indexing of all book modules + local agent testing (no hallucination)
3. THEN Frontend ChatKit widget integration
4. THEN Auto-reindex GitHub Action
5. THEN Full end-to-end testing
6. THEN Deployment

Add new Phase 1.5: "Local Agent Validation"
- Run reindex_docs.py manually
- Test agent with python script: ask questions from book → verify perfect answers + sources
- Only proceed to frontend AFTER agent works perfectly with real data

Move all frontend tasks (swizzle, CustomChatWidgetWidget, etc.) to Phase 3 or later.

Regenerate specs/rag-chatbot/plan.md and other relevant .md files related to plan.md except tasks.md and specs.md with this safe, production-first order.

Go.
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Updated the RAG Chatbot implementation plan to follow a production-first, backend-first approach with proper validation:

1. **Phase 1**: Backend RAG Agent + Qdrant Indexing
2. **Phase 1.5**: Local Agent Validation (manual reindexing and testing)
3. **Phase 2**: Design & Contracts
4. **Phase 3**: Frontend ChatKit Widget Integration
5. **Phase 4**: Auto-Reindex GitHub Action
6. **Phase 5**: Full End-to-End Testing
7. **Phase 6**: Deployment

Updated both `specs/rag-chatbot/plan.md` and `specs/rag-chatbot/quickstart.md` to reflect the new order, with backend implementation and validation completed before any frontend work begins.

## OUTCOME

Successfully restructured the implementation plan to follow a safer, more production-ready approach that validates the core RAG functionality with real data before investing in frontend development. The new Phase 1.5 "Local Agent Validation" ensures the agent works perfectly with real documentation before proceeding to frontend integration.
