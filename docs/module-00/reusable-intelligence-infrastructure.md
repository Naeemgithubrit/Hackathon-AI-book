# Reusable Intelligence Infrastructure

## Overview

This book leverages **Claude Code skills**—specialized, reusable AI agents that accelerate Physical AI and humanoid robotics development. Each skill is an expert in a specific domain (URDF creation, simulation design, perception tuning, LLM orchestration, system validation) and can be invoked on-demand throughout your learning journey.

Think of skills as **intelligent power tools** that remember best practices, catch common errors, and guide you through complex workflows—allowing you to focus on learning concepts rather than debugging syntax errors or configuration issues.

## The Five Core Skills

### 1. URDF Builder
**Domain**: Robot Modeling & Description
**Invocation**: `/skill urdf-builder`

Creates and validates humanoid robot URDF/Xacro files with correct physics, joint configurations, and sensor integrations.

**What it handles**:
- 12-32 DoF humanoid kinematics
- Inertia tensor calculation (no more "robot explodes in Gazebo")
- ros2_control integration (position/velocity/effort controllers)
- Sensor integration (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, force/torque sensors)
- Gazebo plugin declarations
- URDF validation and error detection

**Example use cases**:
- Module 02: Create your first humanoid URDF
- Module 05: Add bimanual manipulation arms
- Module 08: Integrate RealSense camera for perception

**Output**: Production-ready URDF/Xacro files, controller configs, launch files

---

### 2. Gazebo World Builder
**Domain**: Simulation Environment Design
**Invocation**: `/skill gazebo-world-builder`

Builds realistic indoor environments (apartments, offices, warehouses) with furniture, lighting, and domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer.

**What it handles**:
- Floor plans and room layouts
- Furniture and obstacle placement
- Lighting configuration (natural + artificial)
- Physics tuning (friction, restitution, contact parameters)
- Domain randomization (object poses, lighting, textures)
- Navigation-compatible worlds (Nav2 costmap integration)

**Example use cases**:
- Module 03: Build apartment for navigation testing
- Module 06: Create manipulation testbed with tables and shelves
- Module 09: Design domain randomization for sim-to-real policy transfer

**Output**: Gazebo SDF world files, launch files, domain randomization scripts

---

### 3. Isaac Perception Tuner
**Domain**: GPU-Accelerated Perception
**Invocation**: `/skill isaac-perception-tuner`

Configures and tunes Isaac ROS perception packages (cuVSLAM, DetectNet, depth processing) for optimal performance on Jetson hardware with RealSense cameras.

**What it handles**:
- cuVSLAM (GPU-accelerated visual SLAM) tuning
- DetectNet object detection confidence thresholds
- Depth image filtering and point cloud generation
- TensorRT inference optimization
- Latency and accuracy trade-offs for real-time robotics
- Perception quality benchmarking

**Example use cases**:
- Module 04: Configure cuVSLAM for indoor localization
- Module 07: Tune DetectNet for object detection in manipulation tasks
- Module 10: Optimize perception pipeline for Jetson Orin Nano deployment

**Output**: Isaac ROS launch files, config YAMLs, benchmarking scripts, validation reports

### 4. VLA Orchestrator
**Domain**: Natural Language Robot Control
**Invocation**: `/skill vla-orchestrator`

Builds LLM-powered orchestration layers that translate natural language commands ("go to the kitchen and pick up the red mug") into executable ROS 2 action sequences.

**What it handles**:
- LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, local LLaMA models)
- Prompt engineering for task decomposition
- ROS 2 action client execution (Nav2, MoveIt2, gripper control)
- Natural language status updates and error explanations
- Failure handling and re-planning
- Safety guardrails and constraint checking

**Example use cases**:
- Module 11: Add voice control to your humanoid robot
- Module 13: Build conversational HRI layer for household tasks
- Module 15: Integrate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for embodied AI

**Output**: ROS 2 orchestrator nodes, LLM prompt templates, action execution pipelines, test suites

---

### 5. Robot Validator
**Domain**: System Diagnostics & Testing
**Invocation**: `/skill robot-validator`

Autonomous diagnostic agent that validates robot system health, detects configuration errors, and generates actionable repair reports.

**What it handles**:
- URDF integrity checks (joint limits, inertia, collision meshes)
- TF tree validation (missing transforms, loops, disconnected frames)
- Sensor data quality (publication rates, resolution, noise levels)
- Action server availability and responsiveness
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Pre-flight validation before deployment

**Example use cases**:
- Every module: Validate your robot configuration before running demos
- Module 14: Set up CI/CD for continuous integration testing
- Debugging: "My camera isn't publishing—run diagnostics"

**Output**: Validation reports (JSON), GitHub Actions workflows, error fix recommendations

---

## The Orchestrator Agent

**Role**: Intelligent skill dispatcher and workflow coordinator

The orchestrator agent sits above the 5 skills and automatically routes your requests to the correct skill(s) based on keyword detection and intent analysis.

### How It Works

**Single-Skill Routing**:
```
You: "Create a URDF for a 20-DoF humanoid with RealSense camera"
Orchestrator: Detects keywords [URDF, humanoid, RealSense] → routes to urdf-builder
urdf-builder: Guides you through URDF creation workflow
```

**Multi-Skill Workflows**:
```
You: "Set up my robot from scratch"
Orchestrator: Detects "complete_robot_setup" workflow → invokes skills sequentially:
  1. urdf-builder (create robot model)
  2. gazebo-world-builder (create simulation environment)
  3. isaac-perception-tuner (configure perception)
  4. robot-validator (validate complete system)
```

### Routing Keywords

| Skill | Triggers |
|-------|----------|
| **urdf-builder** | urdf, xacro, robot description, humanoid model, joint, link, inertia |
| **gazebo-world-builder** | gazebo, world, environment, apartment, office, furniture, domain randomization |
| **isaac-perception-tuner** | isaac ros, perception, cuVSLAM, detectnet, jetson, realsense, confidence threshold |
| **vla-orchestrator** | natural language, llm, gpt, task planning, voice command, robot brain |
| **robot-validator** | validate, diagnostic, health check, debug, test, ci/cd, tf tree |

### Pre-Defined Workflows

**1. Complete Robot Setup** (End-to-End)
- Steps: URDF → Simulation → Perception → Validation
- Trigger: "Set up my robot from scratch"

**2. Sim-to-Real Pipeline**
- Steps: Gazebo world (with domain randomization) → Perception tuning → Validation on real hardware
- Trigger: "Deploy from simulation to real robot"

**3. Intelligent Manipulation**
- Steps: Manipulator URDF → LLM control → Object detection → Validation
- Trigger: "Build manipulation system with natural language control"

## Why Reusable Intelligence Matters

### Traditional Approach (Without Skills)
```
Developer workflow:
1. Google "how to create URDF inertia"
2. Copy-paste Stack Overflow code (may be outdated)
3. Robot explodes in Gazebo
4. Debug for 2 hours
5. Find typo in inertia tensor
6. Repeat for every new robot project
```

**Time to first working robot**: 8-12 hours (with debugging)

### Skills-Powered Approach
```
Developer workflow:
1. Invoke: /skill urdf-builder
2. Answer guided questions (DoF count, sensor types)
3. Skill generates validated URDF with correct physics
4. Launch in Gazebo → works immediately
```

**Time to first working robot**: 15-30 minutes

### Key Benefits

1. **Error Prevention**: Skills encode years of best practices and catch common mistakes before they happen
2. **Consistency**: Every URDF follows the same conventions, making code review and maintenance easier
3. **Learning Acceleration**: Spend time understanding concepts, not debugging syntax
4. **Scalability**: Create 10 different humanoids as easily as creating 1
5. **CI/CD Ready**: robot-validator integrates directly into your deployment pipeline

```

### Via Natural Language (Orchestrator Handles Routing)

```bash
# Let the orchestrator detect the right skill
"Create a URDF for my humanoid robot"
→ Orchestrator routes to /skill urdf-builder

"Build an apartment simulation"

```

### Via Explicit Workflows

```bash
# Invoke a pre-defined multi-skill workflow
"Run complete robot setup workflow"
→ Orchestrator executes: urdf-builder → gazebo-world-builder → isaac-perception-tuner → robot-validator
